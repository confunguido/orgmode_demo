  abstract = {An important objective in the development of targeted therapies is to identify the populations where the treatment under consideration has positive benefit risk balance. We consider pivotal clinical trials, where the efficacy of a treatment is tested in an overall population and/or in a pre-specified subpopulation. Based on a decision theoretic framework we derive optimized trial designs by maximizing utility functions. Features to be optimized include the sample size and the population in which the trial is performed (the full population or the targeted subgroup only) as well as the underlying multiple test procedure. The approach accounts for prior knowledge of the efficacy of the drug in the considered populations using a two dimensional prior distribution. The considered utility functions account for the costs of the clinical trial as well as the expected benefit when demonstrating efficacy in the different subpopulations. We model utility functions from a sponsor's as well as from a public health perspective, reflecting actual civil interests. Examples of optimized trial designs obtained by numerical optimization are presented for both perspectives.},

An acute disease that tends to respond well to proper treatment, the sometimes intense nature of dengue epidemics has been known to overwhelm healthcare systems and elevate the morbidity and mortality of patients left without adequate medical treatment under peak epidemic conditions. Here, we quantify the temperature dependence of dengue epidemic intensity by quantifying two distinct determinants of epidemic growth rate: the average number of secondary infections arising from each primary infection and the average time between successive infections in humans. Our results show that the time between successive infections in humans decreases steadily with increasing temperatures, whereas the average number of secondary infections peaks at intermediate temperatures. Altogether, this suggests a peak temperature for dengue epidemic intensity. Applying this result to global temperature projections under future climate change scenarios suggests that dengue epidemics in many regions of the world could become more intense under future temperature increases.},

The World Health Organization currently recommends CYD-TDV only for individuals with serological confirmation of past DENV exposure. Our objective was to evaluate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination following serological screening. We used an agent-based model to simulate DENV transmission over a 30-year timeframe, with and without vaccination. We considered a range of values for the proportion of vaccinees with prior DENV exposure. We projected the proportion of symptomatic and hospitalized cases averted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of serological screening. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination under economic scenarios representative of Brazil and the Philippines. We found that public health impact depended primarily on the sensitivity of serological screening in high-transmission settings and on a combination of sensitivity and specificity in low-transmission settings. Reducing risk from an individual perspective required high specificity, no less than 0.8. Cost-effectiveness could be achievable from the perspective of a public payer provided that screening sensitivity for prior DENV exposure and the value of a disability-adjusted life-year were both high. Cost-effectiveness was also achievable from an individual perspective, particularly with high screening specificity and low coverage. Whereas the results of this analysis offer general guidelines about CYD-TDV vaccination, decisions in specific contexts would benefit from additional, more context-specific modeling analyses. Vaccination with CYD-TDV following serological screening could have a positive impact in certain epidemiological settings, provided that screening is highly specific, at least moderately sensitive, and inexpensive.},

  doi = {10.1101/376533},
  abstract = {Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen spread by Aedes mosquitoes that has a considerable impact on global health. Agent-based models can be used to represent explicitly represent factors that are difficult to measure empirically, by focusing on specific aspects of DENV transmission dynamics that influence spread in a particular location. We present a new agent-based model for DENV dynamics, DTK-Dengue, that can be readily applied to new locations and to a diverse set of goals. It extends the vector-borne disease module in the Institute for Disease Modelling\{\textbackslash{}textquoteright\}s Epidemiological Modeling Disease Transmission Kernel (EMOD-DTK) to model DENV dynamics. There are three key modifications present in DTK-Dengue: 1) modifications to how climatic variables influence vector development for Aedes mosquitoes, 2) updates to adult vector behavior to make them more similar to Aedes, and 3) the inclusion of four DENV serotypes, including their effects on human immunity and symptoms. We demonstrate DTK-Dengue\{\textbackslash{}textquoteright\}s capabilities by fitting the model to four interrelated datasets: total and serotype-specific dengue incidences between January 2007 and December 2008 from San Juan, Puerto Rico; the age distribution of reported dengue cases in Puerto Rico during 2007; and the number of adult female Ae. aegypti trapped in two neighborhoods of San Juan between November 2007 and December 2008. The model replicated broad patterns in the reference data, including a correlation between vector population dynamics and rainfall, appropriate seasonality in the reported incidence, greater circulation of DENV-3 than any other serotype, and an inverse relationship between age and the proportion of cases associated with each age group over 20 years old. This exercise demonstrates the potential for DTK-Dengue to assimilate multiple types of epidemiologic data into a realistic portrayal of DENV transmission dynamics. Due to the open availability of the DTK-Dengue software and the availability of numerous other modules for modeling disease transmission and control from EMOD-DTK, this new model has potential for a diverse range of future applications in a wide variety of settings.},

  abstract = {During the last 50 years, the geographic range of the mosquito Aedes aegypti has increased dramatically, in parallel with a sharp increase in the disease burden from the viruses it transmits, including Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. There is a growing consensus that vector control is essential to prevent Aedes-borne diseases, even as effective vaccines become available. What remains unclear is how effective vector control is across broad operational scales because the data and the analytical tools necessary to isolate the effect of vector-oriented interventions have not been available. We developed a statistical framework to model Ae. aegypti abundance over space and time and applied it to explore the impact of citywide vector control conducted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Iquitos, Peru, over a 12-year period. Citywide interventions involved multiple rounds of intradomicile insecticide space spray over large portions of urban Iquitos (up to 40\% of all residences) in response to dengue outbreaks. Our model captured significant levels of spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal variation in Ae. aegypti abundance within and between years and across the city. We estimated the shape of the relationship between the coverage of neighborhood-level vector control and reductions in female Ae. aegypti abundance; i.e., the dose-response curve. The dose-response curve, with its associated uncertainties, can be used to gauge the necessary spraying effort required to achieve a desired effect and is a critical tool currently absent from vector control programs. We found that with complete neighborhood coverage MoH intra-domicile space spray would decrease Ae. aegypti abundance on average by 67\% in the treated neighborhood. Our framework can be directly translated to other interventions in other locations with geolocated mosquito abundance data. Results from our analysis can be used to inform future vector-control applications in Ae. aegypti endemic areas globally.},

  abstract = {Pathogens inflict a wide variety of disease manifestations on their hosts, yet the impacts of disease on the behaviour of infected hosts are rarely studied empirically and are seldom accounted for in mathematical models of transmission dynamics. We explored the potential impacts of one of the most common disease manifestations, fever, on a key determinant of pathogen transmission, host mobility, in residents of the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru. We did so by comparing two groups of febrile individuals (dengue-positive and dengue-negative) with an afebrile control group. A retrospective, semi-structured interview allowed us to quantify multiple aspects of mobility during the two-week period preceding each interview. We fitted nested models of each aspect of mobility to data from interviews and compared models using likelihood ratio tests to determine whether there were statistically distinguishable differences in mobility attributable to fever or its aetiology. Compared with afebrile individuals, febrile study participants spent more time at home, visited fewer locations, and, in some cases, visited locations closer to home and spent less time at certain types of locations. These multifaceted impacts are consistent with the possibility that disease-mediated changes in host mobility generate dynamic and complex changes in host contact network structure.},

  doi = {10.1101/276006},
  abstract = {Background: Temporal incidence patterns provide a crucial window into the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, yet their utility is limited by the spatially aggregated form in which they are often presented. Weekly incidence data from the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic were available only at the national level for most countries in the Americas. One exception was Colombia, where data at departmental and municipal scales were made publicly available in real time, providing an opportunity to assess the degree to which national-level data are reflective of temporal patterns at local levels. Methods: To characterize differences in epidemic trajectories, our analysis centered on classifying proportional cumulative incidence curves according to six features at three levels of spatial aggregation. This analysis used the partitioning around medoids algorithm to assign departments and municipalities to groups based on these six characteristics. Examination of the features that differentiated these groups and exploration of their temporal and spatial patterns were performed. Simulations from a stochastic transmission model provided data that were used to assess the extent to which groups identified by the classification algorithm could be associated with differences in underlying drivers of transmission. Results: The timing of departmental-level epidemic peaks varied by three months, and departmental-level estimates of the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), showed patterns that were distinct from a national-level estimate. The classification algorithm identified moderate support for two to three clusters at the departmental level and somewhat stronger support for this at the municipal level. Variability in epidemic duration, the length of the tail of the epidemic, and the consistency of cumulative incidence data with a cumulative normal distribution function made the greatest contributions to distinctions across these groups. Applying the classification algorithm to simulated data showed that municipalities with basic reproduction number, R0, greater than 1 were consistently associated with a particular group. Municipalities with R0  1 displayed more diverse patterns, although in this case that may be due to simplifications of how the model represented spatial interaction among municipalities. Conclusions: The diversity of temporal incidence patterns at local scales uncovered by this analysis underscores the value of spatially disaggregated data and the importance of locally tailored strategies for responding to emerging infectious diseases.},

Numerical results show the impact of the geographical environment and populations' mobility on the spread of the disease.

Over one year in dengue-endemic Iquitos, Peru, we collected blood fed mosquitoes from 19 households. Mosquito blood meals were then matched to household residents using genetic fingerprinting. We found that within a household, larger individuals and those spending more time in the home were bitten more often than other household residents. Importantly, our results show that one's probability of being bitten is dependent on the characteristics of other household residents and visitors. These results indicate that measurable characteristics of individuals do predict who is most exposed to mosquito-borne pathogens, which contributes to our understanding of pathogen transmission processes, informs development of mathematical disease models, and can enhance the design of targeted control programs.},

The aim of this study was to refine clinical estimates provided by a regional surveillance-system using a two-stage serological assessment as gold standard. Two serosurveys were implemented: first, a rapid survey using stored sera of pregnant women, in order to assess the attack rate at the epidemic upsurge (s1, February 2006; n = 888); second, a population-based survey among a random sample of the community, to assess the herd immunity in the post-epidemic era (s2, October 2006; n = 2442). Sera were screened for anti-CHIKV specific antibodies (IgM and IgG in s1, IgG only in s2) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Seroprevalence rates were compared to clinical estimates of attack rates. In s1, 18.2\% of the pregnant women were tested positive for CHIKV specific antibodies (13.8\% for both IgM and IgG, 4.3\% for IgM, 0.1\% for IgG only) which provided a congruent estimate with the 16.5\% attack rate calculated from the surveillance-system. In s2, the seroprevalence in community was estimated to 38.2\% (95\% CI, 35.9 to 40.6\%). Extrapolations of seroprevalence rates led to estimate, at 143,000 and at 300,000 (95\% CI, 283,000 to 320,000), the number of people infected in s1 and in s2, respectively. In comparison, the surveillance-system estimated at 130,000 and 266,000 the number of people infected for the same periods. A rapid serosurvey in pregnant women can be helpful to assess the attack rate when large seroprevalence studies cannot be done. On the other hand, a population-based serosurvey is useful to refine the estimate when clinical diagnosis underestimates it. Our findings give valuable insights to assess the herd immunity along the course of epidemics.},

There is a wide range of estimates of how many infections result in each of these outcomes. It is known that after a first infection the outcome of a second infection with a different serotype varies over time, but this has not been taken into account in these previous estimates. In this paper, we use modelling methods, combined with information from published dengue research in which individuals are followed over time, to estimate the proportion of infections that result in symptoms at different times after infection. We estimated the proportion of infections that are symptomatic for first infections as 0.18 (95\% Credible Interval, CI: 0.16, 0.20), 0.13 (95\% CI: 0.05, 0.17) for individuals infected in the year following a first infection and 0.41 (95\% CI: 0.36, 0.45) for those experiencing secondary infections after this first year. The estimates here will help understand how cases relate to underlying transmission, which is vital for understanding how much of the population are susceptible to infection and for effectively targeting interventions.},

  doi = {10.1101/082396},
  abstract = {Given the limited effectiveness of strategies based solely on vector control to reduce dengue virus (DENV) transmission, it is expected that an effective vaccine could play a pivotal role in reducing the global disease burden of dengue. Of several dengue vaccines under development, Dengvaxia\textregistered{}from Sanofi Pasteur recently became the first to become licensed in select countries and to achieve WHO recommendation for use in certain settings, despite the fact that a number of uncertainties about its profile complicate projections of its public health impact. We used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission to perform simulations of the public health impact of dengue vaccines in light of two key uncertainties: (1) "statistical uncertainty" about the numerical value of the vaccine\{\textbackslash{}textquoteright\}s efficacy against disease, and (2) "biological uncertainty" about the extent to which its efficacy against disease derives from the amelioration of symptoms, blocking of DENV infection, or some combination thereof. Simulations of a generic dengue vaccine showed that the proportion of disease episodes averted following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year olds at 80\% coverage was sensitive to both the numerical value of vaccine efficacy and to the extent to which efficacy derives from blocking of DENV infection. Simulations of a vaccine resembling Dengvaxia\textregistered{}took into account that vaccine trial results substantially reduced statistical uncertainty but did not address biological uncertainty, resulting in the proportion of disease episodes averted being more sensitive to biological uncertainty than to statistical uncertainty. Taken together, our results indicate limitations associated with the use of symptomatic disease as the primary endpoint of dengue vaccine trials and highlight the importance of considering multiple forms of uncertainty in projections of a vaccine\{\textbackslash{}textquoteright\}s public health impact.},

  abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) has captured worldwide attention with the ongoing epidemic in South America and its link to severe birth defects, most notably microcephaly. ZIKV is spread to humans through a combination of vector and sexual transmission, but the relative contribution of these transmission routes to the overall epidemic remains largely unknown. Furthermore, a disparity in the reported number of infections between males and females has been observed. We develop a mathematical model that describes the transmission dynamics of ZIKV to determine the processes driving the observed epidemic patterns. Our model reveals a 4.8\% contribution of sexual transmission to the basic reproductive number, R0. This contribution is too minor to independently sustain an outbreak but suggests that vector transmission is the main driver of the ongoing epidemic. We also find a minor, yet statistically significant, difference in the mean number of cases in males and females, both at the peak of the epidemic and at equilibrium. While this suggests an intrinsic disparity between males and females, the differences do not account for the vastly greater number of reported cases for females, indicative of a large reporting bias. In addition, we identify conditions under which sexual transmission may play a key role in sparking an epidemic, including temperate areas where ZIKV mosquito vectors are less prevalent.},

As a result, there are currently 45 ZIKV vaccine candidates in development.Areas covered: Both traditional (purified inactivated, live attenuated, viral-vectored, recombinant sub-unit) and novel (DNA, self-replicating RNA, mRNA) vaccine platforms are being utilized. For emergency use, vaccines that are appropriate for women of child-bearing age (including pregnant women) are being developed. Live vaccines that may be contraindicated in pregnancy are also in development for potential inclusion in national immunization programmes in childhood or pre-teenage age groups. WHO developed a target product profile for Zika vaccines for use in an emergency.Expert commentary: Although ZIKV vaccine development had a quick head start, further development may be hampered because of ...},

There were 3,000 cases in a first wave (March-June 2005) and more than 250,000 cases in a second (December 2005-April 2006). Adapting newly developed epidemiological tools to vector-borne diseases, we show that despite this massive difference in magnitude, the transmission potential as measured by the number of secondary cases per index case (or reproduction number), remained similar during the two consecutive waves. The best estimate for the initial reproduction number R(0) was 3.7, with a possible range from 2 to 11 depending on incubation duration and lifespan of the mosquito. We conclude that an increase in virulence between the two seasons was not necessary to explain the change in magnitude of the epidemics, and that the attack rate may be well over 50\% in Chikungunya fever epidemics in the absence of intervention.},

To better understand the drivers of transmission of these two arboviral diseases, we propose a joint analysis of Chikungunya and Zika epidemics in the same territories, taking into account the common epidemiological features of the epidemics: transmitted by the same vector, in the same environments, and observed by the same surveillance systems. We analyse eighteen outbreaks in French Polynesia and the French West Indies using a hierarchical time-dependent SIR model accounting for the effect of virus, location and weather on transmission, and based on a disease specific serial interval. We show that Chikungunya and Zika have similar transmission potential in the same territories (transmissibility ratio between Zika and Chikungunya of 1.04 [95\% credible interval: 0.97; 1.13]), but that detection and reporting rates were different (around 19\% for Zika and 40\% for Chikungunya). Temperature variations between 22\textdegree{}C and 29\textdegree{}C did not alter transmission, but increased precipitation showed a dual effect, first reducing transmission after a two-week delay, then increasing it around five weeks later. The present study provides valuable information for risk assessment and introduces a modelling framework for the comparative analysis of arboviral infections that can be extended to other viruses and territories.},

This document, directed toward national regulatory authorities (NRAs), vaccine developers and the scientific community at large, provides guidance for the evaluation and registration of dengue vaccines in dengue-endemic countries. The new document builds on a previous guidance document published in 2002 [WHO. Guidelines for the evaluation of dengue vaccines in populations exposed to natural infection. Geneva, Switzerland: WHO; 2002 [Report No.: TDR/IVR/DEN/02.1]]. This report summarizes the recommendations in the new guidelines, which emphasize the many unique aspects of dengue vaccine trials. These include strong recommendations to collect accurate dengue incidence data across multiple transmission seasons, and to conduct Phase 2 or 3 bridging studies, post-Phase 3 follow-up safety studies and Phase 4 post-licensure trials to better elucidate vaccine immunogenicity, protective efficacy, or safety in endemic areas where multiple dengue types and other flaviviruses circulate and where flavivirus vaccines are widely used.},

The ABM are coupled with differential equations representing `clouds' of mosquitoes in patches accounting for mosquito ecology. We adapted an ABM for humans using this method and investigated the importance of heterogeneity in pathogen spread, motivating the utility of models of individual behaviour.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND A tetravalent dengue vaccine was shown to be efficacious against symptomatic dengue in two phase III efficacy studies performed in five Asian and five Latin American countries. The objective here was to estimate key parameters of a dengue transmission model using the data collected during these studies. METHODS Parameter estimation was based on a Sequential Monte Carlo approach and used a cohort version of the transmission model. Serotype-specific basic reproduction numbers were derived for each country. Parameters related to serotype interactions included duration of cross-protection and level of cross-enhancement characterized by differences in symptomaticity for primary, secondary and post-secondary infections. We tested several vaccine efficacy profiles and simulated the evolution of vaccine efficacy over time for the scenarios providing the best fit to the data. RESULTS Two reference scenarios were identified. The first included temporary cross-protection and the second combined cross-protection and cross-enhancement upon wild-type infection and following vaccination. Both scenarios were associated with differences in efficacy by serotype, higher efficacy for pre-exposed subjects and against severe dengue, increase in efficacy with doses for na\"ive subjects and by a more important waning of vaccine protection for subjects when na\"ive than when pre-exposed. Over 20 years, the median reduction of dengue risk induced by the direct protection conferred by the vaccine ranged from 24\% to 47\% according to country for the first scenario and from 34\% to 54\% for the second. CONCLUSION Our study is an important first step in deriving a general framework that combines disease dynamics and mechanisms of vaccine protection that could be used to assess the impact of vaccination at a population level.},

Our comparison was based on a comparable sampling effort required to carry out collections with 2 approaches. Over 19,000 specimens were collected, approximately 90\% of which were Culex spp. Sticky traps collected significantly more Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus females than did backpack aspirators when located outdoors. The percentage of positive sticky-trap catches was double for Ae. aegypti and almost 20 times higher for Ae. albopictus. Operational benefits of the sticky trap are discussed within the context of the results obtained.},

The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in parts of west Africa defines an unprecedented health threat. We developed a model of Ebola virus transmission that integrates detailed geographical and demographic data from Liberia to overcome the limitations of non-spatial approaches in projecting the disease dynamics and assessing non-pharmaceutical control interventions. METHODS We modelled the movements of individuals, including patients not infected with Ebola virus, seeking assistance in health-care facilities, the movements of individuals taking care of patients infected with Ebola virus not admitted to hospital, and the attendance of funerals. Individuals were grouped into randomly assigned households (size based on Demographic Health Survey data) that were geographically placed to match population density estimates on a grid of 3157 cells covering the country. The spatial agent-based model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The model was used to estimate Ebola virus transmission parameters and investigate the effectiveness of interventions such as availability of Ebola treatment units, safe burials procedures, and household protection kits. FINDINGS Up to Aug 16, 2014, we estimated that 38\textperiodcentered{}3\% of infections (95\% CI 17\textperiodcentered{}4-76\textperiodcentered{}4) were acquired in hospitals, 30\textperiodcentered{}7\% (14\textperiodcentered{}1-46\textperiodcentered{}4) in households, and 8\textperiodcentered{}6\% (3\textperiodcentered{}2-11\textperiodcentered{}8) while participating in funerals. We noted that the movement and mixing, in hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic, of patients infected with Ebola virus and those not infected was a sufficient driver of the reported pattern of spatial spread. The subsequent decrease of incidence at country and county level is attributable to the increasing availability of Ebola treatment units (which in turn contributed to drastically decreased hospital transmission), safe burials, and distribution of household protection kits. INTERPRETATION The model allows assessment of intervention options and the understanding of their role in the decrease in incidence reported since Sept 7, 2014. High-quality data (eg, to estimate household secondary attack rate, contact patterns within hospitals, and effects of ongoing interventions) are needed to reduce uncertainty in model estimates.

  abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health. Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3\% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8\%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3\% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.},

  abstract = {The unprecedented impact and modeling efforts associated with the 2014\textendash{}2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa provides a unique opportunity to document the performances and caveats of forecasting approaches used in near-real time for generating evidence and to guide policy. A number of international academic groups have developed and parameterized mathematical models of disease spread to forecast the trajectory of the outbreak. These modeling efforts often relied on limited epidemiological data to derive key transmission and severity parameters, which are needed to calibrate mechanistic models. Here, we provide a perspective on some of the challenges and lessons drawn from these efforts, focusing on (1) data availability and accuracy of early forecasts; (2) the ability of different models to capture the profile of early growth dynamics in local outbreaks and the importance of reactive behavior changes and case clustering; (3) challenges in forecasting the long-term epidemic impact very early in the outbreak; and (4) ways to move forward. We conclude that rapid availability of aggregated population-level data and detailed information on a subset of transmission chains is crucial to characterize transmission patterns, while ensemble-forecasting approaches could limit the uncertainty of any individual model. We believe that coordinated forecasting efforts, combined with rapid dissemination of disease predictions and underlying epidemiological data in shared online platforms, will be critical in optimizing the response to current and future infectious disease emergencies.},

  abstract = {Recently, the Vaccines to Vaccinate (v2V) initiative was reconfigured into the Partnership for Dengue Control (PDC), a multi-sponsored and independent initiative. This redirection is consistent with the growing consensus among the dengue-prevention community that no single intervention will be sufficient to control dengue disease. The PDC's expectation is that when an effective dengue virus (DENV) vaccine is commercially available, the public health community will continue to rely on vector control because the two strategies complement and enhance one another. Although the concept of integrated intervention for dengue prevention is gaining increasingly broader acceptance, to date, no consensus has been reached regarding the details of how and what combination of approaches can be most effectively implemented to manage disease. To fill that gap, the PDC proposed a three step process: (1) a critical assessment of current vector control tools and those under development, (2) outlining a research agenda for determining, in a definitive way, what existing tools work best, and (3) determining how to combine the best vector control options, which have systematically been defined in this process, with DENV vaccines. To address the first step, the PDC convened a meeting of international experts during November 2013 in Washington, DC, to critically assess existing vector control interventions and tools under development. This report summarizes those deliberations.},

  abstract = {The Ross-Macdonald model has dominated theory for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics and control for over a century. The model, like many other basic population models, makes the mathematically convenient assumption that populations are well mixed; i.e., that each mosquito is equally likely to bite any vertebrate host. This assumption raises questions about the validity and utility of current theory because it is in conflict with preponderant empirical evidence that transmission is heterogeneous. Here, we propose a new dynamic framework that is realistic enough to describe biological causes of heterogeneous transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens of humans, yet tractable enough to provide a basis for developing and improving general theory. The framework is based on the ecological context of mosquito blood meals and the fine-scale movements of individual mosquitoes and human hosts that give rise to heterogeneous transmission. Using this framework, we describe pathogen dispersion in terms of individual-level analogues of two classical quantities: vectorial capacity and the basic reproductive number, . Importantly, this framework explicitly accounts for three key components of overall heterogeneity in transmission: heterogeneous exposure, poor mixing, and finite host numbers. Using these tools, we propose two ways of characterizing the spatial scales of transmission\textemdash{}pathogen dispersion kernels and the evenness of mixing across scales of aggregation\textemdash{}and demonstrate the consequences of a model's choice of spatial scale for epidemic dynamics and for estimation of , both by a priori model formulas and by inference of the force of infection from time-series data.},

  abstract = {Dengue, the world's most important mosquito-borne viral disease, is endemic in the Philippines. During 2008--2012, the country's Department of Health reported an annual average of 117,065 dengue cases, placing the country fourth in dengue burden in southeast Asia. This study estimates the country's annual number of dengue episodes and their economic cost. Our comparison of cases between active and passive surveillance in Punta Princesa, Cebu City yielded an expansion factor of 7.2, close to the predicted value (7.0) based on the country's health system. We estimated an annual average of 842,867 clinically diagnosed dengue cases, with direct medical costs (in 2012 US dollars) of \$345 million (\$3.26 per capita). This is 54\% higher than an earlier estimate without Philippines-specific costs. Ambulatory settings treated 35\% of cases (representing 10\% of direct costs), whereas inpatient hospitals served 65\% of cases (representing 90\% of direct costs). The economic burden of dengue in the Philippines is substantial.},

However, estimates based on cartographic modeling approaches suggest that up to 390 million dengue infections annually. Dengue has become an increasing public health concern in the Americas. A substantial number of cases in the Americas are reported in Brazil. There is a need for an updated evaluation of the economic impact of dengue in Brazil so as to allow decision/policy makers to make informed decisions on resource allocation and strategic planning. We estimated the economic burden of dengue in four regions. National cost estimates were based on the number of cases reported in Sistema de Informacao de Agravos de Notificacao (SINAN). Overall, 2,035 (91.5\%) dengue cases were recruited to our study. More than 2 million suspected dengue cases and 569 deaths were reported in SINAN from September 2012 to August 2013. The annual national economic burden was US\$ 164 million from the public payer perspective, but may be as high as US\$ 447 million (adjusting for underreporting). From the societal perspective, the economic burden was US\$ 468 million, but may be as high as US\$ 1,212 million. The economic burden associated with dengue in Brazil is substantial.},

  abstract = {Background The incidence of dengue fever (DF) is steadily increasing in Mexico, burdening health systems with consequent morbidities and mortalities. On December 9th, 2015, Mexico became the first country for which the dengue vaccine was approved for use. In anticipation of a vaccine rollout, analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the dengue vaccination program that quantifies the dynamics of disease transmission is essential. Methods We developed a dynamic transmission model of dengue in Yucat\'an, Mexico and its proposed vaccination program to incorporate herd immunity into our analysis of cost-effectiveness analysis. Our model also incorporates important characteristics of dengue epidemiology, such as clinical cross-immunity and susceptibility enhancement upon secondary infection. Using our model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of an imperfect dengue vaccine in Yucat\'an, Mexico. Conclusions Our study indicates that a dengue vaccination program would prevent 90\% of cases of symptomatic DF incidence as well as 90\% of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) incidence and dengue-related deaths annually. We conclude that a dengue vaccine program in Yucat\'an, Mexico would be very cost-effective as long as the vaccination cost per individual is less than \$140 and \$214 from health care and societal perspectives, respectively. Furthermore, at an exemplary vaccination cost of \$250 USD per individual on average, dengue vaccination is likely to be cost-effective 43\% and 88\% of the time from health care and societal perspectives, respectively.},

Searches of published literature in epidemiological studies of dengue disease encompassing the terms ``dengue'', ``epidemiology,''and ``Colombia''were conducted. Studies in English or Spanish published between 1 January 2000 and 23 February 2012 were included. The searches identified 225 relevant citations, 30 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria defined in the review protocol. The epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia was characterized by a stable ``baseline''annual number of dengue fever cases, with major outbreaks in 2001--2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of dengue disease cases showed a steady increase, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue disease recorded during the review period was among those 15 years of age. Gaps identified in epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia may provide several avenues for future research, namely studies of asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary versus secondary infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved understanding of the factors that determine disease expression and enable improvement in disease control and management is also important.},

Estimates derived from incidence data were comparable to those from seroprevalence data, an important conclusion for areas where seroprevalence data are not available. Additionally, the estimated baseline reporting rates and the contribution of primary to tertiary/quaternary infections to observed disease in each country will help to highlight potential weaknesses in the country or region's surveillance system.},

  abstract = {Author summary Transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, dengue affects more than 100 countries and is rapidly emerging as the leading vector-borne disease. There has been a 30-fold increase in the number of cases reported since 1960. The cost of the illness to the health system and to society at large is estimated at several billions of dollars annually. The health sector response has depended in large part on controlling mosquito populations during outbreaks. Recently, the first-ever dengue vaccine received regulatory approval for use in several countries. However, its roll-out and long-term impact still needs to be evaluated in the field. In this paper, we examine how the introduction of this vaccine might alter the investment case for sustained effort to control mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first economic evaluation of mosquito control in the era of the dengue vaccine. We model the cost and effects of mosquito control in Brazil, Columbia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mosquito control in the presence of a vaccine that does not offer full protection to all individuals. Our results suggest that sustained mosquito control will continue to be cost-effective, even if roll-out of the current vaccine is highly targeted and low-cost. These results support current global policies and strategies for the prevention and control of dengue.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes a tetravalent vaccine is needed to protect against the huge burden of dengue disease. Dengvaxia is a vaccine candidate now licensed in several countries for individuals 9--45 years of age living in endemic countries with at least 50\% (preferably 70\%) of seroprevalence. Modelers from Sanofi Pasteur have predicted that this vaccine has the potential to reduce by about 50\% the disease burden within 5 years when 20\% of an endemic country population is vaccinated, thus achieving a World Health Organization dengue prevention goal. In this paper, mathematical modeling is used to investigate the impact of the newly licensed dengue vaccine using different scenarios. Our results show that to achieve significant reduction in disease burden, the vaccination program is most effective if it includes only individuals that have been already exposed to at least one dengue virus. Immunological screening of the population prior to vaccination is advised and vaccination strategies must be planned based on epidemiological disease dynamics for each specific endemic region.},

However, estimating VES is resource-intensive. We aim to identify methods to accurately estimate VES when limited information is available and resources are constrained. We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10\% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values. Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VES is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.},

We used a large-scale, data-driven, agent-based simulation model (ABM) to explore CHIKV mitigation strategies, including strategies based on previous DENV outbreaks. Our model represents CHIKV transmission in a realistic population of Colombia with 45 million individuals in 10.6 million households, schools, and workplaces. Our model uses high-resolution probability maps for the occurrence of the Ae. aegypti mosquito vector to estimate mosquito density in Colombia. We found that vector control in all 521 municipalities with mosquito populations led to 402,940 fewer clinical cases of CHIKV compared to a baseline scenario without intervention. We also explored using data about previous dengue virus (DENV) epidemics to inform CHIKV mitigation strategies. Compared to the baseline scenario, 314,437 fewer cases occurred when we simulated vector control only in 301 municipalities that had previously reported DENV, illustrating the value of available data from previous outbreaks. When varying the implementation parameters for vector control, we found that faster implementation and scale-up of vector control led to the greatest proportionate reduction in cases. Using available data for epidemic simulations can strengthen decision making against new epidemic threats.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human movement is a key behavioral factor in many vector-borne disease systems because it influences exposure to vectors and thus the transmission of pathogens. Human movement transcends spatial and temporal scales with different influences on disease dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual model to evaluate the importance of variation in exposure due to individual human movements for pathogen transmission, focusing on mosquito-borne dengue virus.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We develop a model showing that the relevance of human movement at a particular scale depends on vector behavior. Focusing on the day-biting Aedes aegypti, we illustrate how vector biting behavior combined with fine-scale movements of individual humans engaged in their regular daily routine can influence transmission. Using a simple example, we estimate a transmission rate (R(0)) of 1.3 when exposure is assumed to occur only in the home versus 3.75 when exposure at multiple locations--e.g., market, friend's--due to movement is considered. Movement also influences for which sites and individuals risk is greatest. For the example considered, intriguingly, our model predicts little correspondence between vector abundance in a site and estimated R(0) for that site when movement is considered. This illustrates the importance of human movement for understanding and predicting the dynamics of a disease like dengue. To encourage investigation of human movement and disease, we review methods currently available to study human movement and, based on our experience studying dengue in Peru, discuss several important questions to address when designing a study.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Human movement is a critical, understudied behavioral component underlying the transmission dynamics of many vector-borne pathogens. Understanding movement will facilitate identification of key individuals and sites in the transmission of pathogens such as dengue, which then may provide targets for surveillance, intervention, and improved disease prevention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In light of the increasing rate of dengue infections throughout the world despite vector-control measures, several dengue vaccine candidates are in development.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: In a phase 3 efficacy trial of a tetravalent dengue vaccine in five Latin American countries where dengue is endemic, we randomly assigned healthy children between the ages of 9 and 16 years in a 2:1 ratio to receive three injections of recombinant, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) or placebo at months 0, 6, and 12 under blinded conditions. The children were then followed for 25 months. The primary outcome was vaccine efficacy against symptomatic, virologically confirmed dengue (VCD), regardless of disease severity or serotype, occurring more than 28 days after the third injection.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: A total of 20,869 healthy children received either vaccine or placebo. At baseline, 79.4\% of an immunogenicity subgroup of 1944 children had seropositive status for one or more dengue serotypes. In the per-protocol population, there were 176 VCD cases (with 11,793 person-years at risk) in the vaccine group and 221 VCD cases (with 5809 person-years at risk) in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 60.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 52.0 to 68.0). In the intention-to-treat population (those who received at least one injection), vaccine efficacy was 64.7\% (95\% CI, 58.7 to 69.8). Serotype-specific vaccine efficacy was 50.3\% for serotype 1, 42.3\% for serotype 2, 74.0\% for serotype 3, and 77.7\% for serotype 4. Among the severe VCD cases, 1 of 12 was in the vaccine group, for an intention-to-treat vaccine efficacy of 95.5\%. Vaccine efficacy against hospitalization for dengue was 80.3\%. The safety profile for the CYD-TDV vaccine was similar to that for placebo, with no marked difference in rates of adverse events.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: The CYD-TDV dengue vaccine was efficacious against VCD and severe VCD and led to fewer hospitalizations for VCD in five Latin American countries where dengue is endemic.

  abstract = {Phase III trials of the malaria vaccine, RTS, S, are now underway across multiple sites of varying transmission intensity in Africa. Heterogeneity in exposure, vaccine response and waning of efficacy may bias estimates of vaccine efficacy. Theoretical arguments are used to identify the expected effects of a) heterogeneity in exposure to infectious bites; b) heterogeneity in individual's response to the vaccine; and c) waning efficacy on measures of vaccine efficacy from clinical trials for an infection-blocking vaccine. Heterogeneity in exposure and vaccine response leads to a smaller proportion of trial participants becoming infected than one would expect in a homogeneous setting. This causes estimates of vaccine efficacy from clinical trials to be underestimated if transmission heterogeneity is ignored, and overestimated if heterogeneity in vaccine response is ignored. Waning of vaccine efficacy can bias estimates of vaccine efficacy in both directions. Failure to account for heterogeneities in exposure and response, and waning of efficacy in clinical trials can lead to biased estimates of malaria vaccine efficacy. Appropriate methods to reduce these biases need to be used to ensure accurate interpretation and comparability between trial sites of results from the upcoming Phase III clinical trials of RTS, S.},

  abstract = {A method for the rapid diagnosis of early dengue virus (DENV) infection is highly needed. Here, a prototype reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. The assay detected DENV RNA in 20 min without the need for thermocycling amplification. The assay enabled the detection of as few as 10 copies of DENV RNA. The designed RT-RPA primers and exo probe detected the DENV genome of at least 12 genotypes of DENV circulating globally without cross-reacting with other arboviruses. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of DENV RNA in 203 serum samples of patients with clinically suspected dengue. The sera were simultaneously tested for DENV using a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and IgM- and IgG-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 130 samples and 61 of the samples (46.9\%) were classified as viremic with qRT-PCR. The RT-RPA assay showed good concordance ({$\kappa$} of {$\geq$}0.723) with the RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR assays in detecting the dengue viremic samples. When used in combination with ELISA, both the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays increased the detection of acute DENV infection to {$\geq$}95.7\% ({$\geq$}45/47) in samples obtained within 5 days of illness. The results from the study suggest that the RT-RPA assay is the most rapid molecular diagnostic tool available for the detection of DENV. Hence, it is possible to use the RT-RPA assay in a laboratory to complement routine serology testing for dengue.},

  abstract = {Individual-based models of infectious disease transmission depend on accurate quantification of fine-scale patterns of human movement. Existing models of movement either pertain to overly coarse scales, simulate some aspects of movement but not others, or were designed specifically for populations in developed countries. Here, we propose a generalizable framework for simulating the locations that an individual visits, time allocation across those locations, and population-level variation therein. As a case study, we fit alternative models for each of five aspects of movement (number, distance from home and types of locations visited; frequency and duration of visits) to interview data from 157 residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru. Comparison of alternative models showed that location type and distance from home were significant determinants of the locations that individuals visited and how much time they spent there. We also found that for most locations, residents of two neighbourhoods displayed indistinguishable preferences for visiting locations at various distances, despite differing distributions of locations around those neighbourhoods. Finally, simulated patterns of time allocation matched the interview data in a number of ways, suggesting that our framework constitutes a sound basis for simulating fine-scale movement and for investigating factors that influence it.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phase III trials of the malaria vaccine, RTS, S, are now underway across multiple sites of varying transmission intensity in Africa. Heterogeneity in exposure, vaccine response and waning of efficacy may bias estimates of vaccine efficacy. METHODS: Theoretical arguments are used to identify the expected effects of a) heterogeneity in exposure to infectious bites; b) heterogeneity in individual's response to the vaccine; and c) waning efficacy on measures of vaccine efficacy from clinical trials for an infection-blocking vaccine. RESULTS: Heterogeneity in exposure and vaccine response leads to a smaller proportion of trial participants becoming infected than one would expect in a homogeneous setting. This causes estimates of vaccine efficacy from clinical trials to be underestimated if transmission heterogeneity is ignored, and overestimated if heterogeneity in vaccine response is ignored. Waning of vaccine efficacy can bias estimates of vaccine efficacy in both directions. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to account for heterogeneities in exposure and response, and waning of efficacy in clinical trials can lead to biased estimates of malaria vaccine efficacy. Appropriate methods to reduce these biases need to be used to ensure accurate interpretation and comparability between trial sites of results from the upcoming Phase III clinical trials of RTS, S.},

  abstract = {Dengue virus (DENV) causes a large number of asymptomatic infections, so surveillance captures only a fraction of cases. Salje et al. developed a method for identifying the number of transmission chains of DENV from sequence data and serology. They found that sequential transmission of DENV typically occurs between households in the same neighborhood. Within high-density urban localities, such as Bangkok, there are surprisingly few transmission chains. This results in epidemic spikes within a regional background of endemicity. Large urban settings may thus act as a source of diverse viruses that can be transported elsewhere.Science, this issue p. 1302A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual transmission events. These pathways are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen dispersal at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic transmission. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60\% of dengue cases living 200 meters apart come from the same transmission chain, as opposed to 3\% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances 200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the \{\textbackslash{}textquotedblleft\}enclosed\{\textbackslash{}textquotedblright\} region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent transmission and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of transmission. These findings have important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance.},

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

The synthesis emphasizes the relationships among classic formulae and reformulates a simple dynamic model for the proportion of infected humans. The classic formulae are related to formulae from cyclical feeding models, and some inconsistencies are noted.

  abstract = {Background: Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES), regardless of symptoms, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for pathogens with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection, as such infections may contribute to onward transmission and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome. However, estimating VES is resource-intensive. We aim to identify methods to accurately estimate VES when only a limited amount of information is available and resources are constrained. Methods: We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. The vaccine is leaky, meaning it reduces the probability of infection upon exposure. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). Results: A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once at the end of the trial, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10\% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values of R0. Conclusion: Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VES is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection. Understanding potential sources of bias can allow for more accurate VE estimates in epidemic settings.},

Between November 2003 and October 2004, pupal/demographic surveys were therefore conducted in non-residential sites in the Peruvian city of Iquitos. The sampled sites included schools, factories, ports, public markets, petrol stations, commercial zones, airports, government buildings, animal-production areas, and recreational areas. Compared with the residential sites that had been surveyed a few years earlier, the non-residential sites generally had fewer pupae/ha, even though pupae were found in a high percentage of the sites investigated. Nonetheless, although 56 pupae/ha were observed in the industrial, commercial, recreational and school sites, the river boats in the ports and the areas in and around public markets sometimes had pupal abundances (of 122-213 pupae/ha) that were comparable with those previously recorded in the residential sites. When the relative production of Ae. aegypti was calculated by container type and characteristic (lidded/lidless, indoors/outdoors, and water-use patterns), no single container category was found to be a major producer of Ae. aegypti, with the exception of flower vases in cemeteries. In general, almost all (97\%) of the pupae collected in the non-residential sites came from unlidded containers, although 91\% of those collected in river boats came from lidded storage areas. With the exception of lumber mills, plant nurseries and markets (where only 39\%-60\% of the pupae were collected outdoors), 70\% of pupal production was outdoors. In commercial areas, 41\% of the pupae came from manually-filled containers, compared with 12\% in residential sites. These results indicate that non-residential sites can be highly productive for Ae. aegypti and that the role of such sites in dengue transmission requires further investigation.},

Adults clustered strongly within houses and weakly to a distance of 30 meters beyond the household; clustering was not detected beyond 10 meters for positive containers or pupae. Over short periods of time restricted flight range and frequent blood-feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti appear to be underlying factors in the clustering patterns of human dengue infections. Permanent, consistently infested containers (key premises) were not major producers of Ae. aegypti, indicating that larvaciding strategies by themselves may be less effective than reduction of mosquito development sites by source reduction and education campaigns. We conclude that entomologic risk of human dengue infection should be assessed at the household level at frequent time intervals.},

This paper presents a validation of CIMSiM simulating Ae. aegypti using several independent series of data that were not used in model development. Validation data sets include laboratory work designed to elucidate the role of diet on fecundity and rates of larval development and survival. Comparisons are made with four field studies conducted in Bangkok, Thailand, on seasonal changes in population dynamics and with a field study in New Orleans, LA, on larval habitat. Finally, predicted ovipositional activity of Ae. aegypti in seven cities in the southeastern United States for the period 1981-1985 is compared with a data set developed by the U.S. Public Health Service. On the basis of these comparisons, we believe that, for stated design goals, CIMSiM adequately simulates the population dynamics of Ae. aegypti in response to specific information on weather and immature habitat. We anticipate that it will be useful in simulation studies concerning the development and optimization of control strategies and that, with further field validation, can provide entomological inputs for a dengue virus transmission model.},

  abstract = {Background: An estimated 100 million people have symptomatic dengue infection every year. This is the first report of a phase 3 vaccine efficacy trial of a candidate dengue vaccine. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the CYD dengue vaccine against symptomatic, virologically confirmed dengue in children. Methods: We did an observer-masked, randomised controlled, multicentre, phase 3 trial in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Between June 3, and Dec 1, 2011, healthy children aged 2-14 years were randomly assigned (2:1), by computer-generated permuted blocks of six with an interactive voice or web response system, to receive three injections of a recombinant, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), or placebo, at months 0, 6, and 12. Randomisation was stratified by age and site. Participants were followed up until month 25. Trial staff responsible for the preparation and administration of injections were unmasked to group allocation, but were not included in the follow-up of the participants; allocation was concealed from the study sponsor, investigators, and parents and guardians. Our primary objective was to assess protective efficacy against symptomatic, virologically confirmed dengue, irrespective of disease severity or serotype, that took place more than 28 days after the third injection. The primary endpoint was for the lower bound of the 95\% CI of vaccine efficacy to be greater than 25\%. Analysis was by intention to treat and per procotol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01373281. Findings: We randomly assigned 10 275 children to receive either vaccine (n=6851) or placebo (n=3424), of whom 6710 (98\%) and 3350 (98\%), respectively, were included in the primary analysis. 250 cases of virologically confirmed dengue took place more than 28 days after the third injection (117 [47\%] in the vaccine group and 133 [53\%] in the control group). The primary endpoint was achieved with 56\textperiodcentered{}5\% (95\% CI 43\textperiodcentered{}8-66\textperiodcentered{}4) efficacy. We recorded 647 serious adverse events (402 [62\%] in the vaccine group and 245 [38\%] in the control group). 54 (1\%) children in the vaccine group and 33 (1\%) of those in the control group had serious adverse events that happened within 28 days of vaccination. Serious adverse events were consistent with medical disorders in this age group and were mainly infections and injuries. Interpretation: Our findings show that dengue vaccine is efficacious when given as three injections at months 0, 6, and 12 to children aged 2-14 years in endemic areas in Asia, and has a good safety profile. Vaccination could reduce the incidence of symptomatic infection and hospital admission and has the potential to provide an important public health benefit.

  doi = {10.1038/nature16041},
  abstract = {Ebola emerged in West Africa around December 2013 and swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, giving rise to 27,748 confirmed, probable and suspected cases reported by 29 July 2015. Case diagnoses during the epidemic have relied on polymerase chain reaction-based tests. Owing to limited laboratory capacity and local transport infrastructure, the delays from sample collection to test results being available have often been 2 days or more. Point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests offer the potential to substantially reduce these delays. We review Ebola rapid diagnostic tests approved by the World Health Organization and those currently in development. Such rapid diagnostic tests could allow early triaging of patients, thereby reducing the potential for nosocomial transmission. In addition, despite the lower test accuracy, rapid diagnostic test-based diagnosis may be beneficial in some contexts because of the reduced time spent by uninfected individuals in health-care settings where they may be at increased risk of infection; this also frees up hospital beds. We use mathematical modelling to explore the potential benefits of diagnostic testing strategies involving rapid diagnostic tests alone and in combination with polymerase chain reaction testing. Our analysis indicates that the use of rapid diagnostic tests with sensitivity and specificity comparable with those currently under development always enhances control, whether evaluated at a health-care-unit or population level.

The determinants of clinical severity remain unclear, though studies indicate a titer-dependent and time-dependent role of cross-protective anti-DENV antibodies.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: Data from 2 sequential prospective cohort studies were analyzed for subclinical and symptomatic DENV infections in schoolchildren in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand (1998-2002 and 2004-2007). Children experiencing {$\geq$} 1 DENV infection were selected as the population for analysis (contributing 2169 person-years of follow-up).\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: In total, 1696 children had {$\geq$} 1 DENV infection detected during their enrollment; 268 experienced 2 or more infections. A shorter time interval between infections was associated with subclinical infection in children seronegative for DENV at enrollment, for whom a second-detected DENV infection is more likely to reflect a true second infection (average of 2.6 years between infections for DHF, 1.9 for DF, and 1.6 for subclinical infections).\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: These findings support a pathogenesis model where cross-reactive antibodies wane from higher-titer, protective levels to lower-titer, detrimental levels.

  abstract = {Although the determinants of infectious disease transmission have been extensively investigated in small social structures such as households or schools, the impact of the wider environment (e.g., neighborhood) on transmission has received less attention. Here we use an outbreak of chikungunya as a case study where detailed epidemiological data were collected and combine it with statistical approaches to characterize the multiple factors that influence the risk of infectious disease transmission and may depend on characteristics of the individual (e.g., age, sex), of his or her close relatives (e.g., household members), or of the wider neighborhood. Our findings highlight the role that integrating statistical approaches with in-depth information on the at-risk population can have on understanding pathogen spread.Whether an individual becomes infected in an infectious disease outbreak depends on many interconnected risk factors, which may relate to characteristics of the individual (e.g., age, sex), his or her close relatives (e.g., household members), or the wider community. Studies monitoring individuals in households or schools have helped elucidate the determinants of transmission in small social structures due to advances in statistical modeling; but such an approach has so far largely failed to consider individuals in the wider context they live in. Here, we used an outbreak of chikungunya in a rural community in Bangladesh as a case study to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of risk factors in disease spread. We developed Bayesian data augmentation approaches to account for uncertainty in the source of infection, recall uncertainty, and unobserved infection dates. We found that the probability of chikungunya transmission was 12\% [95\% credible interval (CI): 8\{\textbackslash{}textendash\}17\%] between household members but dropped to 0.3\% for those living 50 m away (95\% CI: 0.2\{\textbackslash{}textendash\}0.5\%). Overall, the mean transmission distance was 95 m (95\% CI: 77\{\textbackslash{}textendash\}113 m). Females were 1.5 times more likely to become infected than males (95\% CI: 1.2\{\textbackslash{}textendash\}1.8), which was virtually identical to the relative risk of being at home estimated from an independent human movement study in the country. Reported daily use of antimosquito coils had no detectable impact on transmission. This study shows how the complex interplay between the characteristics of an individual and his or her close and wider environment contributes to the shaping of infectious disease epidemics.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0210041},
  abstract = {Vaccine efficacy (VE) estimates are crucial for assessing the suitability of dengue vaccine candidates for public health implementation, but efficacy trials are subject to a known bias to estimate VE toward the null if heterogeneous exposure is not accounted for in the analysis of trial data. In light of many well-characterized sources of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, our goal was to estimate the potential magnitude of this bias in VE estimates for a hypothetical dengue vaccine. To ensure that we realistically modeled heterogeneous exposure, we simulated city-wide DENV transmission and vaccine trial protocols using an agent-based model calibrated with entomological and epidemiological data from long-term field studies in Iquitos, Peru. By simulating a vaccine with a true VE of 0.8 in 1,000 replicate trials each designed to attain 90\% power, we found that conventional methods underestimated VE by as much as 21\% due to heterogeneous exposure. Accounting for the number of exposures in the vaccine and placebo arms eliminated this bias completely, and the more realistic option of including a frailty term to model exposure as a random effect reduced this bias partially. We also discovered a distinct bias in VE estimates away from the null due to lower detectability of primary DENV infections among seronegative individuals in the vaccinated group. This difference in detectability resulted from our assumption that primary infections in vaccinees who are seronegative at baseline resemble secondary infections, which experience a shorter window of detectable viremia due to a quicker immune response. This resulted in an artefactual finding that VE estimates for the seronegative group were approximately 1\% greater than for the seropositive group. Simulation models of vaccine trials that account for these factors can be used to anticipate the extent of bias in field trials and to aid in their interpretation.},

We investigated the efficacy of a recombinant, live, attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine. Methods: In this observer-masked, randomised, controlled, monocentre, phase 2b, proof-of-concept trial, healthy Thai schoolchildren aged 4-11 years were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive three injections of dengue vaccine or control (rabies vaccine or placebo) at months 0, 6, and 12. Randomisation was by computer-generated permuted blocks of six and participants were assigned with an interactive response system. Participants were actively followed up until month 25. All acute febrile illnesses were investigated. Dengue viraemia was confirmed by serotype-specific RT-PCR and non-structural protein 1 ELISA. The primary objective was to assess protective efficacy against virologically confirmed, symptomatic dengue, irrespective of severity or serotype, occurring 1 month or longer after the third injection (per-protocol analysis). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00842530. Findings: 4002 participants were assigned to vaccine (n=2669) or control (n=1333). 3673 were included in the primary analysis (2452 vaccine, 1221 control). 134 cases of virologically confirmed dengue occurred during the study. Efficacy was 30\textperiodcentered{}2 (95 CI -13\textperiodcentered{}4 to 56\textperiodcentered{}6), and differed by serotype. Dengue vaccine was well tolerated, with no safety signals after 2 years of follow-up after the first dose. Interpretation: These data show for the first time that a safe vaccine against dengue is possible. Ongoing large-scale phase 3 studies in various epidemiological settings will provide pivotal data for the CYD dengue vaccine candidate. Funding: Sanofi Pasteur. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Geographic cluster studies can elucidate these features in greater detail than cohort studies alone.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: A 4-year longitudinal cohort and geographic cluster study was undertaken in rural Thailand. Cohort children underwent pre-/postseason serology and active school absence-based surveillance to detect inapparent and symptomatic dengue. Cluster investigations were triggered by cohort dengue and non-dengue febrile illnesses (positive and negative clusters, respectively).\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: The annual cohort incidence of symptomatic dengue ranged from 1.3\% to 4.4\%. DENV-4 predominated in the first 2 years, DENV-1 in the second 2 years. The inapparent-to-symptomatic infection ratio ranged from 1.1:1 to 2.9:1. Positive clusters had a 16.0\% infection rate, negative clusters 1.1\%. Of 119 infections in positive clusters, 59.7\% were febrile, 20.2\% were afebrile with other symptoms, and 20.2\% were asymptomatic. Of 16 febrile children detected during cluster investigations who continued to attend school, 9 had detectable viremia.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Dengue transmission risk was high near viremic children in both high- and low-incidence years. Inapparent infections in the cohort overestimated the rate of asymptomatic infections. Ambulatory children with mild febrile viremic infections could represent an important component of dengue transmission.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transmission of dengue viruses (DENV), the leading cause of arboviral disease worldwide, is known to vary through time and space, likely owing to a combination of factors related to the human host, virus, mosquito vector, and environment. An improved understanding of variation in transmission patterns is fundamental to conducting surveillance and implementing disease prevention strategies. To test the hypothesis that DENV transmission is spatially and temporally focal, we compared geographic and temporal characteristics within Thai villages where DENV are and are not being actively transmitted.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Cluster investigations were conducted within 100 m of homes where febrile index children with (positive clusters) and without (negative clusters) acute dengue lived during two seasons of peak DENV transmission. Data on human infection and mosquito infection/density were examined to precisely (1) define the spatial and temporal dimensions of DENV transmission, (2) correlate these factors with variation in DENV transmission, and (3) determine the burden of inapparent and symptomatic infections. Among 556 village children enrolled as neighbors of 12 dengue-positive and 22 dengue-negative index cases, all 27 DENV infections (4.9\% of enrollees) occurred in positive clusters (p  0.01; attributable risk [AR] = 10.4 per 100; 95\% confidence interval 1-19.8 per 100]. In positive clusters, 12.4\% of enrollees became infected in a 15-d period and DENV infections were aggregated centrally near homes of index cases. As only 1 of 217 pairs of serologic specimens tested in positive clusters revealed a recent DENV infection that occurred prior to cluster initiation, we attribute the observed DENV transmission subsequent to cluster investigation to recent DENV transmission activity. Of the 1,022 female adult Ae. aegypti collected, all eight (0.8\%) dengue-infected mosquitoes came from houses in positive clusters; none from control clusters or schools. Distinguishing features between positive and negative clusters were greater availability of piped water in negative clusters (p  0.01) and greater number of Ae. aegypti pupae per person in positive clusters (p = 0.04). During primarily DENV-4 transmission seasons, the ratio of inapparent to symptomatic infections was nearly 1:1 among child enrollees. Study limitations included inability to sample all children and mosquitoes within each cluster and our reliance on serologic rather than virologic evidence of interval infections in enrollees given restrictions on the frequency of blood collections in children.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal the remarkably focal nature of DENV transmission within a hyperendemic rural area of Thailand. These data suggest that active school-based dengue case detection prompting local spraying could contain recent virus introductions and reduce the longitudinal risk of virus spread within rural areas. Our results should prompt future cluster studies to explore how host immune and behavioral aspects may impact DENV transmission and prevention strategies. Cluster methodology could serve as a useful research tool for investigation of other temporally and spatially clustered infectious diseases.},

Few human cases were reported until 2007, when a Zika outbreak occurred in Yap, Micronesia, even though ZIKV activity had been reported in Africa and in Asia through virological surveillance and entomological studies. French Polynesia has recorded a large outbreak since October 2013. A great number of cases and some with neurological and autoimmune complications have been reported in a context of concurrent circulation of dengue viruses. The clinical presentation is a "dengue-like syndrome". Until the epidemic in French Polynesia, no severe ZIKV disease had been described so far. The diagnosis is confirmed by viral genome detection by genomic amplification (RT- PCR) and viral isolation. These two large outbreaks occurred in a previously unaffected area in less than a decade. They should raise awareness as to the potential for ZIKV to spread especially since this emergent disease is not well known and that some questions remain on potential reservoirs and transmission modes as well as on clinical presentations and complications. ZIKV has the potential to spread to new areas where the Aedes mosquito vector is present and could be a risk for Southern Europe. Strategies for the prevention and control of ZIKV disease should include the use of insect repellent and mosquito vector eradication.},

Traditional EMs, based on hazard rate ratio (HRR) or cumulative incidence ratio (CIR) are time-sensitive to mode of vaccine action and population heterogeneities. Through Monte-Carlo simulation, the performance of HRR and CIR based EMs are examined across different trial designs and vaccine and population characteristics. A new EM based on log-spline hazard regression (HARE) is proposed. Given that vaccinal properties (mode of action, time-lag, waning) are unknown a priori, appropriate selection of EM is problematic, and HRR and CIR can be unreliable to estimate the true maximum efficacy of candidate products. Non-random sexual mixing can exacerbate biases in HRR and CIR. HARE can offer valid estimation across different modes of vaccine action and in presence of frailty effects, contrary to its traditional counterparts. Our simulation studies highlight the weaknesses of widely used EMs while offering guidelines for trial design and suggesting new avenues for statistical analysis.},

  abstract = {Geospatial data sciences have emerged as critical requirements for high-priority application solutions in diverse areas, including, but not limited to, the mitigation of natural and man-made disasters. Three sets of metrics, adopted or customized from geo-statistics, applied meteorology and signal processing, are tested in terms of their ability to evaluate geospatial datasets, specifically two population databases commonly used for disaster preparedness and consequence management. The two high-resolution, grid-based population datasets are the following: The LandScan dataset available from the Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) group at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) dataset available from the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) group at Columbia University. Case studies evaluate population data across the globe, specifically, the metropolitan areas of Washington DC, USA, Los-Angeles, USA, and Houston, USA, and London, UK, as well as the country of Iran. The geospatial metrics confirm that the two population datasets have significant differences, especially in the context of their utility for disaster readiness and mitigation. While this paper primarily focuses on grid based population datasets and disaster management applications, the sets of metrics developed here can be generalized to other geospatial datasets and applications. Future research needs to develop metrics for geospatial and temporal risks and associated uncertainties in the context of disaster management.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1314933111},
  abstract = {Infectious disease models play a key role in public health planning. These models rely on accurate estimates of key transmission parameters such as the force of infection (FoI), which is the per-capita risk of a susceptible person being infected. The FoI captures the fundamental dynamics of transmission and is crucial for gauging control efforts, such as identifying vaccination targets. Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne, multiserotype pathogen that currently infects {$\sim$}390 million people a year. Existing estimates of the DENV FoI are inaccurate because they rely on the unrealistic assumption that risk is constant over time. Dengue models are thus unreliable for designing vaccine deployment strategies. Here, we present to our knowledge the first time-varying (daily), serotype-specific estimates of DENV FoIs using a spline-based fitting procedure designed to examine a 12-y, longitudinal DENV serological dataset from Iquitos, Peru (11,703 individuals, 38,416 samples, and 22,301 serotype-specific DENV infections from 1999 to 2010). The yearly DENV FoI varied markedly across time and serotypes (0-0.33), as did daily basic reproductive numbers (0.49-4.72). During specific time periods, the FoI fluctuations correlated across serotypes, indicating that different DENV serotypes shared common transmission drivers. The marked variation in transmission intensity that we detected indicates that intervention targets based on one-time estimates of the FoI could underestimate the level of effort needed to prevent disease. Our description of dengue virus transmission dynamics is unprecedented in detail, providing a basis for understanding the persistence of this rapidly emerging pathogen and improving disease prevention programs.},

This vaccine has recently cleared Phase III, and efficacy results have been published. Excellent tetravalent seroconversion was seen, yet the protective efficacy against infection was surprisingly low.

Furthermore, we will discuss the human antibody responses during infection, including the epitopes targeted in humans.

We determined Aedes aegypti flight range and dispersal patterns from 21 mark-release-recapture experiments conducted over 11 years (1991-2002) in Puerto Rico and Thailand. Dispersal was compared by release location, sex, age, season, and village. For all experiments, the majority of mosquitoes were collected from their release house or adjacent house. Inter-village movement was detected rarely, with a few mosquitoes moving a maximum of 512 meters from one Thai village to the next. Average dispersal distances were similar for males and females and females released indoors versus outdoors. The movement of Ae. aegypti was not influenced by season or age, but differed by village. Results demonstrate that adult Ae. aegypti disperse relatively short distances, suggesting that people rather than mosquitoes are the primary mode of dengue virus dissemination within and among communities.},

Overall, mosquitoes from Thailand contained significantly more multiple meals (n = 1,300, 42\% double meals, 5\% triple meals) than mosquitoes collected in Puerto Rico (n = 1,156, 32\% double meals, 2\% triple meals). The portion of specimens for which frequency of feeding could not be determined was 31\% at both sites. We estimated that on average Ae. aegypti take 0.76 and 0.63 human blood meals per day in Thailand and Puerto Rico, respectively. However, frequency of multiple feeding varied among houses and, in Puerto Rico, the neighborhoods from which mosquitoes were collected. In Thailand 65\% of the mosquitoes fed twice on the same day, whereas in Puerto Rico 57\% took multiple meals separated by  or = 1 d. At both sites, the majority of engorged specimens were collected inside houses (Thailand 86\%, Puerto Rico 95\%). The number of blood meals detected was independent of where mosquitoes were collected (inside versus outside of the house) at both sites and the time of day collections were made in Puerto Rico. Feeding rates were slightly higher for mosquitoes collected in the afternoon in Thailand. Temperatures were significantly higher and mosquitoes significantly smaller in Thailand than in Puerto Rico. At both sites female size was negatively associated with temperature. Rates of multiple feeding were associated positively with temperature and negatively with mosquito size in Thailand, but not in Puerto Rico. Multiple feeding during a single gonotrophic cycle is a regular part of Ae. aegypti biology, can vary geographically and under different climate conditions, and may be associated with variation in patterns of dengue virus transmission.},

People with inapparent dengue virus infections are generally considered dead-end hosts for transmission because they do not reach sufficiently high viremia levels to infect mosquitoes. Here, we show that, despite their lower average level of viremia, asymptomatic people can be infectious to mosquitoes. Moreover, at a given level of viremia, DENV-infected people with no detectable symptoms or before the onset of symptoms are significantly more infectious to mosquitoes than people with symptomatic infections. Because DENV viremic people without clinical symptoms may be exposed to more mosquitoes through their undisrupted daily routines than sick people and represent the bulk of DENV infections, our data indicate that they have the potential to contribute significantly more to virus transmission to mosquitoes than previously recognized.},

However, considerable theoretical and practical issues impede the capacity of agent-based methods to examine and evaluate causal effects and thus illuminate new areas for intervention. We build on this work by describing how agent-based models can be used to simulate counterfactual outcomes in the presence of complexity. We show that these models are of particular utility when the hypothesized causal mechanisms exhibit a high degree of interdependence between multiple causal effects and when interference (i.e., one person's exposure affects the outcome of others) is present and of intrinsic scientific interest. Although not without challenges, agent-based modeling (and complex systems methods broadly) represent a promising novel approach to identify and evaluate complex causal effects, and they are thus well suited to complement other modern epidemiologic methods of etiologic inquiry.},

The virus is endemic to tropical regions, but the spread of Aedes albopictus into Europe and the Americas coupled with high viraemia in infected travellers returning from endemic areas increases the risk that this virus could establish itself in new endemic regions. This Seminar focuses on the re-emergence of this disease, the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis of virus-induced arthralgia, diagnostic techniques, and various treatment modalities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first term is similar to the case of a constant vector population p but with p replaced by the average vector population p(0). The maximum correction due to the second term is (epsilon(2)/8)\% and always tends to decrease R(0). The basic reproduction number R(0) is defined through the spectral radius of a linear integral operator. Four numerical methods for the computation of R(0) are compared using as example a model for the 2005/2006 chikungunya epidemic in La R\'eunion. The approximate formula and the numerical methods can be used for many other epidemic models with seasonality.},

  issn = {1121-7138},
  abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus belonging to the Togaviridae family, first isolated in Tanzania in 1952. The main vectors are mosquitoes from the Aedes species. Recently, the establishment of an envelope mutation increased infectivity for A. albopictus. CHIKV has recently re-emerged causing millions of infections in countries around the Indian Ocean characterized by climate conditions favourable to high vector density. Importation of human cases to European regions with high density of suitable arthropod vectors (such as A. albopictus) may trigger autochthonous outbreaks. The clinical signs of CHIKV infection include non-specific flu-like symptoms, and a characteristic rash accompanied by joint pain that may last for a long time after the resolution of the infection. The death rate is not particularly high, but excess mortality has been observed in concomitance with large CHIKV outbreaks. Deregulation of innate defense mechanisms, such as cytokine inflammatory response, may participate in the main clinical signs of CHIKV infection, and the establishment of persistent (chronic) disease. There is no specific therapy, and prevention is the main countermeasure. Prevention is based on insect control and in avoiding mosquito bites in endemic countries. Diagnosis is based on the detection of virus by molecular methods or by virus culture on the first days of infection, and by detection of an immune response in later stages. CHIKV infection must be suspected in patients with compatible clinical symptoms returning from epidemic/endemic areas. Differential diagnosis should take into account the cross-reactivity with other viruses from the same antigenic complex (i.e. O'nyong-nyong virus).},

  abstract = {This article examines the role of environmental and individual factors in the social epidemiology of chikungunya disease on the island of Mayotte (South-western Indian Ocean). In an epidemic setting, an interdisciplinary study combining interviews, observations, and serological tests was conducted to: (1) estimate the frequency and social distribution of chikungunya disease and (2) identify its principal cognitive, behavioral, and environmental determinants within a stratified random sample of the Mayotte population (n=888). Semi-parametric tests and multiple correspondence analyses were used to describe the statistical relationships between the different classes of variables examined in this study and the presence of antibodies attributable to chikungunya. These analyses highlighted differences between two main types of populations: one more autochthonous, more urban and better educated population, which shared 'legitimate' representations of the disease-from a biomedical viewpoint; and the other more migrant, more suburban, and more deprived, which is characterized by folk theories of chikungunya virus infection. Moreover, a series of logistic regression models revealed that social disparities in the distribution of virus infection were primarily structured by the housing conditions and cognitive representations of the disease held by the participants. These results suggest that environmental and individual factors are equally crucial in epidemic settings, and that they could explain, to a considerable extent, the social differences observed in morbidity associated with recent emerging infectious diseases in tropical countries. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the first reports of its existence in Africa in the 1950s, more than 1500 scientific publications on the different aspects of the disease and its causative agent have been produced. Analysis of these publications shows that, following a number of studies in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the absence of autochthonous cases in developed countries, the interest of the scientific community remained low. However, in 2005 chikungunya fever unexpectedly re-emerged in the form of devastating epidemics in and around the Indian Ocean. These outbreaks were associated with mutations in the viral genome that facilitated the replication of the virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Since then, nearly 1000 publications on chikungunya fever have been referenced in the PubMed database. This article provides a comprehensive review of chikungunya fever and CHIKV, including clinical data, epidemiological reports, therapeutic aspects and data relating to animal models for in vivo laboratory studies.

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate the clinical features of chikungunya fever (CHIKF) outbreak in Sri Lanka in 2006 and to estimate the relative risk for CHIKF for various demographic factors. Methods: A total of 885 individuals belonging to 200 families were studied individually for surveillance of this disease, symptoms, contraction order within the family and means of treatments. Relative risks for CHIKF for demographic characters such as gender, age and educational levels were estimated. The associations of symptoms with age and gender were also studied. Results: The estimated surveillance of CHIKF in the studied population was 89.2\%. The duration of suffering due to this disease was 50.9 d (95\% CI, 47.3, 53.9 d) with fever for 3.9 d (95\% CI, 3.7, 4.1 d). 93\% of the CHIKF patients felt at least one type of joint pain and 8\% felt joint swellings. Rash was observed in 15.1\% of the patients. Buccal bleeding and mouth ulcer were observed in 1.5\% and 9.3\% respectively. About 22.7\% of the CHIKF patients had vomiting. Female had 1.48 folder higher relative risk for CHIKF infection. The duration suffered due to CHIKF, duration of fever and contraction order within family were highly associated with age (P0.000). Female patients had more than one folder higher relative risks for the symptoms such as rash, vomiting, buccal bleeding and mouth ulcer (P0.000). Conclusions: The surveillance of CHIKF in Sri Lanka was a severe outbreak which infected much on female and caused more suffering on aged population. The symptoms such as rash, bleeding from mucosa, mouth ulcer and vomiting were highly associated with gender. The reasons for these observations need to be further explored. ?? 2014 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press.},

  abstract = {During summer 2007 Italy has experienced an epidemic caused by Chikungunya virus - the first large outbreak documented in a temperate climate country - with approximately 161 laboratory confirmed cases concentrated in two bordering villages in North-Eastern Italy comprising 3,968 inhabitants. The seroprevalence was recently estimated to be 10.2\%. In this work we provide estimates of the transmission potential of the virus and we assess the efficacy of the measures undertaken by public health authorities to control the epidemic spread. To such aim, we developed a model describing the temporal dynamics of the competent vector, known as Aedes albopictus, explicitly depending on climatic factors, coupled to an epidemic transmission model describing the spread of the epidemic in both humans and mosquitoes. The cumulative number of notified cases predicted by the model was 185 on average (95\% CI 117-278), in good agreement with observed data. The probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an infective human case was estimated to be in the range of 32\%-76\%. We found that the basic reproduction number was in the range of 1.8-6 but it could have been even larger, depending on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn depends on seasonal meteorological effects, besides other local abiotic factors. These results confirm the increasing risk of tropical vector-borne diseases in temperate climate countries, as a consequence of globalization. However, our results show that an epidemic can be controlled by performing a timely intervention, even if the transmission potential of Chikungunya virus is sensibly high.},

  abstract = {Most studies on the ability of insect populations to transmit pathogens consider only constant temperatures and do not account for realistic daily temperature fluctuations that can impact vector-pathogen interactions. Here, we show that diurnal temperature range (DTR) affects two important parameters underlying dengue virus (DENV) transmission by Aedes aegypti. In two independent experiments using different DENV serotypes, mosquitoes were less susceptible to virus infection and died faster under larger DTR around the same mean temperature. Large DTR (20 \textdegree{}C) decreased the probability of midgut infection, but not duration of the virus extrinsic incubation period (EIP), compared with moderate DTR (10 \textdegree{}C) or constant temperature. A thermodynamic model predicted that at mean temperatures 18 \textdegree{}C, DENV transmission increases as DTR increases, whereas at mean temperatures 18 \textdegree{}C, larger DTR reduces DENV transmission. The negative impact of DTR on Ae. aegypti survival indicates that large temperature fluctuations will reduce the probability of vector survival through EIP and expectation of infectious life. Seasonal variation in the amplitude of daily temperature fluctuations helps to explain seasonal forcing of DENV transmission at locations where average temperature does not vary seasonally and mosquito abundance is not associated with dengue incidence. Mosquitoes lived longer and were more likely to become infected under moderate temperature fluctuations, which is typical of the high DENV transmission season than under large temperature fluctuations, which is typical of the low DENV transmission season. Our findings reveal the importance of considering short-term temperature variations when studying DENV transmission dynamics.},

Ae. aegypti mosquitos were reared under standard conditions and inoculated intrathoracically with dengue virus. Virus propagation in the mosquitos was determined at the temperature and relative humidity of all 3 seasons of Yangon and for the simulated temperature and relative humidity of Singapore. The virus propagation was detected by direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT) with mosquito head squash and the virus titer was determined by plaque forming unit test (PFUT) in baby hamster kidney-21 cells. The results show that the infected mosquitos kept under the conditions of the rainy season and under the simulated conditions of Singapore had a significantly higher virus titer (p=0.05) when compared with the other 2 seasons of Yangon. So it is thought that the temperature and relative humidity of the rainy season of Yangon and that of Singapore favors dengue virus propagation in the mosquito and is one of the contributing factors to the occurence of DHF outbreaks.},

Chikungunya has recently spread to the island of St. Martin and subsequently throughout the Americas. The disease is now affecting 42 countries and territories throughout the Americas. While chikungunya is mainly a tropical disease, the recent introduction and subsequent spread of Ae. albopictus into temperate regions has increased the threat of chikungunya outbreaks beyond the tropics. Given that there are currently no vaccines or treatments for chikungunya, vector control remains the primary measure to curtail transmission. To investigate the effectiveness of a containment strategy that combines disease surveillance, localized vector control and transmission reduction measures, we developed a model of chikungunya transmission dynamics within a large residential neighborhood, explicitly accounting for human and mosquito movement. Our findings indicate that prompt targeted vector control efforts combined with measures to reduce transmission from symptomatic cases to mosquitoes may be highly effective approaches for controlling outbreaks of chikungunya, provided that sufficient detection of chikungunya cases can be achieved.},

We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification.

Additionally, climate variability plays an important role in the transmission dynamics. A large scientific consensus has indicated that the strong association between climatic variables and disease could be used to develop models to explain the incidence of the disease. Objective: To develop a model that provides a better understanding of dengue transmission dynamics in Medellin and predicts increases in the incidence of the disease. Materials and methods: The incidence of dengue fever was used as dependent variable, and weekly climatic factors (maximum, mean and minimum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation) as independent variables. Expert Modeler was used to develop a model to better explain the behaviorof the disease. Climatic variables with significant association to the dependent variable were selected through ARIMA models. Results: The model explains 34\% of observed variability. Precipitation was the climatic variable showing statistically significant association with the incidence of dengue fever, but with a 20 weeks delay. Conclusions: In Medellin, the transmission of dengue fever was influenced by climate variability, especially precipitation. The strong association dengue fever/precipitation allowed the construction of a model to help understand dengue transmission dynamics. This information will be useful to develop appropriate and timely strategies for dengue control. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7705/biomedica.v33i0.1444},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dengue viruses transmitted principally by the urban mosquito Aedes aegypti, cause one of the major public health problems confronting tropical cities. Insecticide spraying has been the mainstay of mosquito control; however, its continuous use has selected for resistance. Other important methods of control involve community participation.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluated two control methods for Ae. aegypti that can be used by the community: Lethal ovitraps (LOs) and Bacillus thuringiensis var israeliensis (Bti) briquettes.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The project study was carried out in four similar neighborhoods within a representative district in the city of Cali, Colombia. Three interventions (LO, Bti, LO+Bti plus education and one control (education only) area were evaluated for efficacy in post-intervention entomological surveys. Additionally, entomological indices were also compared to results from a pre-intervention survey carried out on a sample of city blocks in the same neighborhoods. Relative vector abundance in relation to weather conditions using the same entomological sampling methods was compared.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: The interventions did not achieve significant differences in vector abundance among the treatments. However, the interventions achieved a significant reduction in entomological indices compared with those observed during the pre-intervention survey: House index 15.1\% vs. 8.5\%, mean pupae per house 1.15 vs. 0.073, and Adult index 56.3\% vs. 34.8\% (p  0.05).\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant differences among the interventions, and between treated and control blocks suggested that educational activities together with periodic visits to the houses produced similar reductions of immature and adult Aedes aegypti.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) window and door curtains alone or in combination with LLIN water container covers were analysed regarding effectiveness in reducing dengue vector density, and feasibility of the intervention.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: A cluster randomised trial was conducted in an urban area of Colombia comparing 10 randomly selected control and 10 intervention clusters. In control clusters, routine vector control activities were performed. The intervention delivered first, LLIN curtains (from July to August 2013) and secondly, water container covers (from October to March 2014). Cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline (February 2013 to June 2013), 9 weeks after the first intervention (August to October 2013), and 4-6 weeks after the second intervention (March to April 2014).\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: Curtains were installed in 922 households and water container covers in 303 households. The Breteau index (BI) fell from 14 to 6 in the intervention group and from 8 to 5 in the control group. The additional intervention with LLIN covers for water containers showed a significant reduction in pupae per person index (PPI) (p=0.01). In the intervention group, the PPI index showed a clear decline of 71\% compared with 25\% in the control group. Costs were high but options for cost savings were identified.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Short term impact evaluation indicates that the intervention package can reduce dengue vector density but sustained effect will depend on multiple factors.},

  abstract = {Unprecedented incidence of dengue has been recorded in Sri Lanka in recent times. Source reduction and use of insecticides in space spraying/fogging and larviciding, are the primary means of controlling the vector mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus in the island nation. A study was carried out to understand insecticide cross-resistance spectra and mechanisms of insecticide resistance of both these vectors from six administrative districts, i.e. Kandy, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Gampaha, Ratnapura and Jaffna, of Sri Lanka. Efficacy of the recommended dosages of frequently used insecticides in space spraying and larviciding in dengue vector control programmes was also tested.Insecticide bioassay results revealed that, in general, both mosquito species were highly resistant to DDT but susceptible to propoxur and malathion except Jaffna Ae. aegypti population. Moderate resistance to malathion shown by Jaffna Ae. aegypti population correlated with esterase and malathion carboxylesterase activities of the population. High levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) insensitivity in the absence of malathion and propoxur resistance may be due to non-synaptic forms of AChE proteins. Moderate pyrethroid resistance in the absence of high monooxygenase levels indicated the possible involvement of 'kdr' type resistance mechanism in Sri Lankan dengue vectors.Results of the space spraying experiments revealed that 100\% mortality at a 10. m distance and 50\% mortality at a 50. m distance can be achieved with malathion, pesguard and deltacide even in a ground with dense vegetation. Pesguard and deltacide spraying gave 100\% mortality up to 50. m distance in open area and areas with little vegetation. Both species gave 50\% mortalities for deltacide at a distance of 75. m in a dense vegetation area. Larval bioassays conducted in the laboratory showed that a 1. ppm temephos solution can maintain a larval mortality rate of 100\% for ten months, and the mortality rate declined to 0\% in the eleventh month. In the field, where 1. ppm concentration is gradually decreased with water usage, 100\% mortality was observed only for the first four months, 50\% mortality for the next two months, and 0\% mortality was observed eight months after the application of temephos. Deltacide can be effectively used for space spraying programmes in Sri Lanka. Larval control can be successfully achieved through temephos with public participation. ?? 2013.},

  abstract = {Aedes aegypti is the main vector for dengue and urban yellow fever. It is extended around the world not only in the tropical regions but also beyond them, reaching temperate climates. Because of its importance as a vector of deadly dis-eases, the significance of its distribution in urban areas and the possibility of breed-ing in laboratory facilities, Aedes aegypti is one of the best-known mosquitoes. In this work the biology of Aedes aegypti is incorporated into the framework of a stochastic population dynamics model able to handle seasonal and total extinction as well as endemic situations. The model incorporates explicitly the dependence with temperature. The ecological parameters of the model are tuned to the present populations of Aedes aegypti in Buenos Aires city, which is at the border of the present day geographical distribution in South America. Temperature thresholds for the mosquito survival are computed as a function of average yearly tempera-ture and seasonal variation as well as breeding site availability. The stochastic anal-ysis suggests that the southern limit of Aedes aegypti distribution in South America is close to the 15 \textbullet{} C average yearly isotherm, which accounts for the historical and current distribution better than the traditional criterion of the winter (July) 10 \textbullet{} C isotherm.},

  title = {Assessing the Impact of Next-Generation Rapid Diagnostic Tests on {{Plasmodium}} Falciparum Malaria Elimination Strategies},
  doi = {10.1038/nature16040},
  abstract = {S94 3 December 2015 | 7580 | 528 P lasmodium falciparum malaria was responsible for an estimated 584,000 (range 367,000\textendash{}755,000) deaths in 2013, most of which oc-curred in young children in sub-Saharan Africa 1 . Although the burden has reduced in response to global efforts to increase the provision of prov-en malaria interventions such as insecticide-treated bed nets and access to health care and treatment 1 , it remains high. One of the challenges in reducing malaria transmission is the long duration of infection in the human host, which in semi-immune individuals may persist for a year or more 2 . In particular, al-though infection often leads to disease in naive individuals, those with suf-ficient acquired immunity can harbour parasites \textemdash{} and hence be onwardly infectious to mosquitoes \textemdash{} without exhibiting symptoms 3 . One option for speeding the decline in transmission could be to target the asymptomatic reservoir of infection 4 by providing either periodic mass-screen-and-treat (MSAT) programmes, focal MSAT or a reactive strategy in which individu-als living in the vicinity of an identified clinical case are screened and treated. However, the extent to which such strategies are able to reduce the infectious reservoir will depend on the extent to which the diagnostic used to identify infected individuals also detects those who are onwardly infectious. Anoth-er form of targeting could take place at the population level (for example a village) where mass interventions are deployed if the population prevalence Mass-screen-and-treat and targeted mass-drug-administration strategies are being considered as a means to interrupt transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, the effectiveness of such strategies will depend on the extent to which current and future diagnostics are able to detect those individuals who are infectious to mosquitoes. We estimate the relationship between par-asite density and onward infectivity using sensitive quantitative parasite diagnostics and mosquito feeding assays from Burkina Faso. We find that a diagnostic with a lower detection limit of 200 parasites per microlitre would detect 55\% of the infectious reservoir (the combined infectivity to mosquitoes of the whole population weighted by how often each individual is bitten) whereas a test with a limit of 20 parasites per microlitre would detect 83\% and 2 parasites per microlitre would detect 95\% of the infectious reser-voir. Using mathematical models, we show that increasing the diagnostic sensitivity from 200 parasites per microlitre (equivalent to microscopy or current rapid diagnostic tests) to 2 parasites per microlitre would increase the number of regions where transmission could be interrupted with a mass-screen-and-treat programme from an entomological inoculation rate below 1 to one of up to 4. The higher sensitivity diagnostic could reduce the number of treatment rounds required to interrupt transmission in areas of lower prevalence. We predict that mass-screen-and-treat with a highly sensitive diagnostic is less effective than mass drug administration owing to the prophylactic protection provided to uninfected individuals by the latter approach. In low-transmission settings such as those in Southeast Asia, we find that a diagnostic tool with a sensitivity of 20 parasites per microlitre may be sufficient for targeted mass drug administration because this diagnostic is predicted to identify a similar village population prevalence compared with that currently detected using polymerase chain reaction if treatment levels are high and screening is conducted during the dry season. Along with other factors, such as coverage, choice of drug, timing of the intervention, importation of infections, and seasonality, the sensitivity of the diagnostic can play a part in increasing the chance of interrupting transmission.

  abstract = {Dengue, the most common mosquito-borne viral infection of humans, is endemic across much of the world, including much of tropical Asia and is increasing in its geographical range. Here, we present a mathematical model of dengue virus dynamics within infected individuals, detailing the interaction between virus and a simple immune response. We fit this model to measurements of plasma viral titre from cases of primary and secondary DENV 1 infection in Vietnam. We show that variation in model parameters governing the immune response is sufficient to create the observed variation in virus dynamics between individuals. Estimating model parameter values, we find parameter differences between primary and secondary cases consistent with the theory of antibody-dependent enhancement (namely enhanced rates of viral entry to target cells in secondary cases). Finally, we use our model to examine the potential impact of an antiviral drug on the within-host dynamics of dengue. We conclude that the impact of antiviral therapy on virus dynamics is likely to be limited if therapy is only started at the onset of symptoms, owing to the typically late stage of viral pathogenesis reached by the time symptoms are manifested and thus treatment is started.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the within-host viral dynamics of dengue infections have been increasingly characterized, and the relationship between aspects of these dynamics and the manifestation of severe disease has been increasingly probed. Despite this progress, there are few mathematical models of within-host dengue dynamics, and the ones that exist focus primarily on the general role of immune cells in the clearance of infected cells, while neglecting other components of the immune response in limiting viraemia. Here, by considering a suite of mathematical within-host dengue models of increasing complexity, we aim to isolate the critical components of the innate and the adaptive immune response that suffice in the reproduction of several well-characterized features of primary and secondary dengue infections. By building up from a simple target cell limited model, we show that only the innate immune response is needed to recover the characteristic features of a primary symptomatic dengue infection, while a higher rate of viral infectivity (indicative of antibody-dependent enhancement) and infected cell clearance by T cells are further needed to recover the characteristic features of a secondary dengue infection. We show that these minimal models can reproduce the increased risk of disease associated with secondary heterologous infections that arises as a result of a cytokine storm, and, further, that they are consistent with virological indicators that predict the onset of severe disease, such as the magnitude of peak viraemia, time to peak viral load, and viral clearance rate. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of these virological indicators to predict the onset of severe disease depends on the contribution of T cells in fuelling the cytokine storm.},

We outline clinical trial phases for identifying and validating diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Predictive biomarkers, more generally termed companion diagnostic tests predict treatment response in terms of efficacy and/or safety. We consider suitability of clinical trial designs for predictive biomarkers, including a detailed discussion of validation study designs, with emphasis on interpretation of study results.

One approach to determine relevant subpopulations are subgroup analyses where the treatment effect is estimated in biomarker positive and biomarker negative groups. Subgroup analyses are challenging because several types of risks are associated with inference on subgroups. On the one hand, by disregarding a relevant subpopulation a treatment option may be missed due to a dilution of the treatment effect in the full population. Furthermore, even if the diluted treatment effect can be demonstrated in an overall population, it is not ethical to treat patients that do not benefit from the treatment when they can be identified in advance. On the other hand, selecting a spurious subpopulation increases the risk to restrict an efficacious treatment to a too narrow fraction of a potential benefiting population. We propose to quantify these risks with utility functions and investigate nonadaptive study designs that allow for inference on subgroups using multiple testing procedures as well as adaptive designs, where subgroups may be selected in an interim analysis. The characteristics of such adaptive and nonadaptive designs are compared for a range of scenarios.},

They allow to map the difference in importance as well as the relationship between the various research questions onto an adequate multiple test procedure. Since these procedures rely on the closed test principle, they usually require the explicit specification of a large number of intersection hypotheses tests. The underlying test strategy may therefore be difficult to communicate. We propose a simple iterative graphical approach to construct and perform such Bonferroni-type tests. The resulting multiple test procedures are represented by directed, weighted graphs, where each node corresponds to an elementary hypothesis, together with a simple algorithm to generate such graphs while sequentially testing the individual hypotheses. The approach is illustrated with the visualization of several common gatekeeping strategies. A case study is used to illustrate how the methods from this article can be used to tailor a multiple test procedure to given study objectives.},

Efficient RCT design is therefore crucial for timely introduction of these medical advances into clinical practice, and a variety of designs have been proposed for this purpose. To guide design and interpretation of RCTs evaluating biomarkers, we present an in-depth comparison of advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used designs. Key aspects of the discussion include efficiency comparisons and special interim monitoring issues that arise because of the complexity of these RCTs. Important ongoing and completed trials are used as examples.

In the recent past multiple test procedures have been developed that reflect the relative importance of different study objectives, such as fixed sequence, fallback, and gatekeeping procedures. In addition, graphical approaches have been proposed that facilitate the visualization and communication of Bonferroni-based closed test procedures for common multiple test problems, such as comparing several treatments with a control, assessing the benefit of a new drug for more than one endpoint, combined non-inferiority and superiority testing, or testing a treatment at different dose levels in an overall and a subpopulation. In this paper, we focus on extended graphical approaches by dissociating the underlying weighting strategy from the employed test procedure. This allows one to first derive suitable weighting strategies that reflect the given study objectives and subsequently apply appropriate test procedures, such as weighted Bonferroni tests, weighted parametric tests accounting for the correlation between the test statistics, or weighted Simes tests. We illustrate the extended graphical approaches with several examples. In addition, we describe briefly the gMCP package in R, which implements some of the methods described in this paper.},

  doi = {10.1002/sim.2965},
  abstract = {Current practice for sample size computations in clinical trials is largely based on frequentist or classical methods. These methods have the drawback of requiring a point estimate of the variance of the treatment effect and are based on arbitrary settings of type I and II errors. They also do not directly address the question of achieving the best balance between the cost of the trial and the possible benefits from using the new treatment, and fail to consider the important fact that the number of users depends on the evidence for improvement compared with the current treatment. Our approach, Behavioural Bayes (or BeBay for short), assumes that the number of patients switching to the new medical treatment depends on the strength of the evidence that is provided by clinical trials, and takes a value between zero and the number of potential patients. The better a new treatment, the more the number of patients who want to switch to it and the more the benefit is obtained. We define the optimal sample size to be the sample size that maximizes the expected net benefit resulting from a clinical trial. Gittins and Pezeshk (Drug Inf. Control 2000; 34:355-363; The Statistician 2000; 49(2):177-187) used a simple form of benefit function and assumed paired comparisons between two medical treatments and that the variance of the treatment effect is known. We generalize this setting, by introducing a logistic benefit function, and by extending the more usual unpaired case, without assuming the variance to be known.},

  abstract = {Subgroup analyses in addition to the total study population analysis are common in clinical trials. However, it is well recognized that findings from subgroup analyses do not provide confirmatory evidence for subgroup treatment effects without placing a priori criteria for ensuring that their findings are scientifically sound. In this paper we address some of the common pitfalls of subgroup analyses. Subgroups analyses inherently have low power for detecting treatment effects. We investigate the power interplay for a subgroup analysis and that for the total study population and list factors that impact the power of a subgroup analysis. Then we introduce a flexible statistical strategy for testing a pre-specified sequence of hypotheses for both the overall and a subgroup. The proposed method strongly controls the familywise Type I error rate and enjoys higher power than other traditional methods. This testing strategy allows testing for a subgroup once a pre-specified degree of consistency in the efficacy findings between the subgroup and the overall study population is met. In addition, it accounts for the dependency between test statistics for the subgroup and the overall study population. We discuss the power performance of this new method and provide significance levels for subgroup analysis. Finally, we illustrate its application through retrospective analysis of data from three published clinical trials.},

  abstract = {A significant heterogeneity in response across subgroups of a clinical trial implies that the average response from the overall population might not characterize the treatment effect; and as noted by different regulatory guidances, can cause concerns in interpreting study findings and might lead to restricting treatment labeling. However, along with the challenges raised by the heterogeneity, recently there has been growing interest in taking advantage of the expected variability in response across subgroups to increase the chance of success of a trial by designing the trial with objectives of establishing efficacy claims for the total population and a targeted subgroup. For such trials, there have been several approaches to address the multiplicity issue with the two paths of success. This manuscript advocates the utility of setting a threshold on the treatment effect for the subgroups at the design stage to guide determination of the population labeling when significant findings for the total population have been established. Specifically, it proposes that licensing treatment for the total population requires, in addition to significant findings for this population, that the treatment effect in the least benefited (complementary) subgroup meets the treatment effect threshold at a minimum; otherwise, the treatment would be restricted to the targeted subgroup only. Setting such a threshold can be based on clinical considerations, including toxicity and adverse events, in addition to treatment effect in the subgroup. This manuscript expands some of the multiplicity approaches to account for the threshold requirement and investigates the impact of the threshold requirement on study power.},

  abstract = {When investigating a new therapy, there is often some plausibility that the treatment is more efficient (or efficient only) in a subgroup as compared to the total patient population. In this situation, the target population for the proof of efficacy is commonly selected in a data-dependent way, for example, based on the results of a pilot study or a planned interim analysis. The performance of the applied selection rule is crucial for the success of a clinical trial or even a drug development program. We consider the situation in which the selection of the patient population is based on a biomarker and where the diagnostic that evaluates the biomarker may be perfect, that is, with 100\% sensitivity and specificity, or not. We develop methods that allow an evaluation of the operational characteristics of rules for selecting the target population, thus enabling the choice of an appropriate strategy. Especially, the proposed procedures can be used to calculate the sample size required to achieve a specified selection probability. Furthermore, we derive optimal selection rules by modeling the uncertainty about parameters by prior distributions. Throughout, there is a strong impact of sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker on the results. It is therefore essential to evaluate the rules for patient selection before applying them, thereby bearing in mind that the diagnostic that evaluates the applied biomarker may be imperfect.},

Identifying such a population with an acceptable level of confidence may lead to an inflation in development time and cost. We present an approach that allows to decrease these costs and to increase the reliability of the population selection. It is based on an actual adaptive phase II/III design and uses Bayesian decision tools to select the population of interest at an interim analysis. The primary endpoint is assumed to be the time to some event like e.g. progression. It is shown that the use of appropriately stratified logrank tests in the adaptive test procedure guarantees overall type I error control also when using information on patients that are censored at the adaptive interim analysis. The use of Bayesian decision tools for the population selection decision making is discussed. Simulations are presented to illustrate the operating characteristics of the study design relative to a more traditional development approach. Estimation of treatment effects is considered as well.},

Commonly, sample size calculation of phase III is based on the treatment effect observed in phase II. Therefore, planning of phases II and III can be linked. The performance of the phase II/III program crucially depends on the allocation of the resources to phases II and III by appropriate choice of the sample size and the rule applied to decide whether to stop the program after phase II or to proceed. We present methods for a program-wise phase II/III planning that aim at determining optimal phase II sample sizes and go/no-go decisions in a time-to-event setting. Optimization is based on a utility function that takes into account (fixed and variable) costs of the drug development program and potential gains after successful launch.

  abstract = {Subgroup analyses in clinical trials are becoming increasingly important. In cancer research more and more targeted therapies are explored and probably only a portion of the whole population will benefit from them. Subgroups of interest can be analyzed in several ways, but a correction of the type I error probability is needed in order to appropriately draw conclusions. Often a conservative Bonferroni approach is taken where the total significance level is distributed (equally or unequally) over the analysis including all patients (overall analysis) and the subgroup analysis. However, more efficient methods are available that take into account the correlation that exists between the test statistics for the overall and the subgroup analysis. The latter approaches are very appealing but have not found their way into practice. The aim of this paper is to show that these methods are the same as the methods used when dealing with interim analyses, i.e., group sequential methods, and hence standard software can be used to calculate the appropriate significance levels. Further, we show that this correction can be applied even when the size of the subgroup is unknown until the end of the trial. Using a simulation study with survival data, we also show that the familywise error rate is well controlled, even with small sample sizes. We hope that this will promote the use of these methods in future cancer clinical trials.},

Specifically, biomarkers can aid in patient stratification (risk assessment), treatment response identification (surrogate markers), or differential diagnosis (identifying individuals who are likely to respond to specific drugs). In this study, we explore two major topics in relation to the design of clinical trials for predictive marker validation. First, we discuss the appropriateness of an enrichment (i.e., targeted) vs. an unselected design through case studies focusing on the clinical question(s) at hand, the strength of the preliminary evidence, and assay reproducibility. Second, we evaluate the efficiency (total number of events and sample size) of two unselected predictive marker designs for validation of a marker under a wide range of clinically relevant scenarios, exploring the impact of the prevalence of the marker and the hazard ratios for the treatment comparisons. The review and evaluation of these designs represents an essential step toward the goal of personalized medicine because we explicitly seek to explore and evaluate the methodology for the clinical validation of biomarker guided therapy.},

Before proceeding to phase III, randomized phase II trials are often used to decide whether the new therapy warrants phase III testing. In the presence of a putative biomarker, the phase II trial should also provide information as to what type of biomarker phase III trial is appropriate. A randomized phase II biomarker trial design is proposed, which, after completion, recommends the type of phase III trial to be used for the definitive testing of the therapy and the biomarker. The recommendations include the possibility of proceeding to a randomized phase III of the new therapy with or without using the biomarker and also the possibility of not testing the new therapy further. Evaluations of the proposed trial design using simulations and published data demonstrate that it works well in providing recommendations for phase III trial design.},

The journal does not exist anymore but the methodology found widespread interest in the scientific community over the past 25\,years. The use of such multistage adaptive designs raised many controversial discussions from the beginning on, especially after the publication by Bauer and K\"ohne 1994 in Biometrics: Broad enthusiasm about potential applications of such designs faced critical positions regarding their statistical efficiency. Despite, or possibly because of, this controversy, the methodology and its areas of applications grew steadily over the years, with significant contributions from statisticians working in academia, industry and agencies around the world. In the meantime, such type of adaptive designs have become the subject of two major regulatory guidance documents in the US and Europe and the field is still evolving. Developments are particularly noteworthy in the most important applications of adaptive designs, including sample size reassessment, treatment selection procedures, and population enrichment designs. In this article, we summarize the developments over the past 25\,years from different perspectives. We provide a historical overview of the early days, review the key methodological concepts and summarize regulatory and industry perspectives on such designs. Then, we illustrate the application of adaptive designs with three case studies, including unblinded sample size reassessment, adaptive treatment selection, and adaptive endpoint selection. We also discuss the availability of software for evaluating and performing such designs. We conclude with a critical review of how expectations from the beginning were fulfilled, and - if not - discuss potential reasons why this did not happen.},

These therapies are assumed to show a greater benefit in a pre-specified subgroup of patients-commonly identified by a predictive biomarker-as compared to the total patient population of interest. This situation has led to the necessity to develop biostatistical methods allowing an efficient evaluation of such treatments. Among others, adaptive enrichment designs have been proposed as a solution. These designs allow the selection of the most promising patient population based on an efficacy analysis at interim and restricting recruitment to these patients afterwards. As has recently been shown, the performance of the applied interim decision rule in such a design plays a crucial role in ensuring a successful trial. In this work, we investigate the situation when the primary outcome of the trial is a binary variable. Optimal decision rules are derived which incorporate the uncertainty about the treatment effects. These optimal decision rules are evaluated with respect to their performance in an adaptive enrichment design in terms of correct selection probability and power, and are compared to proposed ad hoc decision rules. Our methods are illustrated by means of a clinical trial example.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Declining incidence and spatial heterogeneity complicated the design of phase 3 Ebola vaccine trials during the tail of the 2013\textendash{}16 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa. Mathematical models can provide forecasts of expected incidence through time and can account for both vaccine efficacy in participants and effectiveness in populations. Determining expected disease incidence was critical to calculating power and determining trial sample size. METHODS In real-time, we fitted, forecasted, and simulated a proposed phase 3 cluster-randomized vaccine trial for a prime-boost EVD vaccine in three candidate regions in Sierra Leone. The aim was to forecast trial feasibility in these areas through time and guide study design planning. RESULTS EVD incidence was highly variable during the epidemic, especially in the declining phase. Delays in trial start date were expected to greatly reduce the ability to discern an effect, particularly as a trial with an effective vaccine would cause the epidemic to go extinct more quickly in the vaccine arm. Real-time updates of the model allowed decision-makers to determine how trial feasibility changed with time. CONCLUSIONS This analysis was useful for vaccine trial planning because we simulated effectiveness as well as efficacy, which is possible with a dynamic transmission model. It contributed to decisions on choice of trial location and feasibility of the trial. Transmission models should be utilised as early as possible in the design process to provide mechanistic estimates of expected incidence, with which decisions about sample size, location, timing, and feasibility can be determined.},

  volume = {12},
  doi = {10.1186/1475-2875-12-253},
  abstract = {Background: Sample size has increasingly become a prerequisite for grant approval. Study size calculations for multicentre trials are more complicated because these sites present different assumptions on incidence of disease expected in the control group; this then changes the mechanism of sample size determination. This paper suggested an alternative approach to estimating study size in multicentre vaccine efficacy trials. Methods: The approach suggested in this paper was to determine the expected number of events for a given sample size under set of different assumptions. The power was then calculated given the expected number of events under the set of assumptions so as to assess the sensitivity of the sample size. The approach was then illustrated assuming a malaria vaccine efficacy trial planned in four centres. Results: The approach showed that by assuming 30\% cumulative incidence of malaria in three of the centres and 10\% cumulative incidence in the other centre, a sample size of 460 children in each centre (total 1,840) corresponding to a total of 339 events gives 90\% power to detect vaccine efficacy of 30\% at 5\% level of significance, allowing for 15\% loss to follow-up. However, if the incidence is lower than anticipated or a centre drops out altogether the power will be low. But this would not have much effect if it were a low incidence centre. Rather, it might have major effect if it were a high incidence centre. Discussion: Decision on recruitment depends on whether separate estimates of efficacy in each transmission level are reasonable. If not, equal numbers can be recruited, which then gives safety data for each site and overall efficacy. Recruiting all or most subjects in the highest transmission site can minimize sample size but may be better to spread the risk due to uncertainty about incidence due to year to year variation and also the possibility of a site dropping due to political or other unforeseen problems. Conclusion: The approach demonstrated the potential of estimating the expected number of events required to give a specified power for multicentre efficacy trails of blood stage malaria antigens.

We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Phase III lots of a candidate vaccine (CYD-TDV) in children in Malaysia. METHODS In this observer-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study, children aged 2\textendash{}11 years were randomized (4:1) to receive CYD-TDV or placebo at 0, 6 and 12 months. Primary endpoints included assessment of reactogenicity following each dose, adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) reported throughout the study, and immunogenicity expressed as geometric mean titres (GMTs) and distribution of dengue virus (DENV) neutralizing antibody titres. RESULTS 250 participants enrolled in the study (CYD-TDV: n=199; placebo: n=51). There was a trend for reactogenicity to be higher with CYD-TDV than with placebo post-dose 1 (75.4\% versus 68.6\%) and post-dose 2 (71.6\% versus 62.0\%) and slightly lower post-dose 3 (57.9\% versus 64.0\%). Unsolicited AEs declined in frequency with each subsequent dose and were similar overall between groups (CYD-TDV: 53.8\%; placebo: 49.0\%). Most AEs were of Grade 1 intensity and were transient. SAEs were reported by 5.5\% and 11.8\% of participants in the CYD-TDV and placebo groups, respectively. No deaths were reported. Baseline seropositivity against each of the four DENV serotypes was similar between groups, ranging from 24.0\% (DENV-4) to 36.7\% (DENV-3). In the CYD-TDV group, GMTs increased post-dose 2 for all serotypes compared with baseline, ranging from 4.8 (DENV-1) to 8.1-fold (DENV-3). GMTs further increased post-dose 3 for DENV-1 and DENV-2. Compared with baseline, individual titre increases ranged from 6.1-fold (DENV-1) to 7.96-fold (DENV-3). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated a satisfactory safety profile and a balanced humoral immune response against all four DENV serotypes for CYD-TDV administered via a three-dose regimen to children in Malaysia.},

  abstract = {Dengue is a significant threat to public health worldwide. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines available for dengue. Takeda Vaccines Inc. is developing a live, attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TDV) that consists of an attenuated DENV-2 strain (TDV-2) and three chimeric viruses containing the prM and E protein genes of DENV-1, -3 and -4 expressed in the context of the attenuated TDV-2 genome backbone (TDV-1, TDV-3, and TDV-4, respectively). TDV has been shown to be immunogenic and efficacious in nonclinical animal models. In interferon-receptor deficient mice, the vaccine induces humoral neutralizing antibody responses and cellular immune responses that are sufficient to protect from lethal challenge with DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-4. In non-human primates, administration of TDV induces innate immune responses as well as long lasting antibody and cellular immunity. In Phase 1 clinical trials, the safety and immunogenicity of two different formulations were assessed after intradermal or subcutaneous administration to healthy, flavivirus-na\"ive adults. TDV administration was generally well-tolerated independent of dose and route. The vaccine induced neutralizing antibody responses to all four DENV serotypes: after a single administration of the higher formulation, 24\textendash{}67\%\% of the subjects seroconverted to all four DENV and 80\% seroconverted to three or more viruses. In addition, TDV induced CD8+ T cell responses to the non-structural NS1, NS3 and NS5 proteins of DENV. TDV has been also shown to be generally well tolerated and immunogenic in a Phase 2 clinical trial in dengue endemic countries in adults and children as young as 18 months. Additional clinical studies are ongoing in preparation for a Phase 3 safety and efficacy study.},

The efficacy of the recently approved quadrivalent CYD-TDV dengue vaccine against asymptomatic dengue virus infection has not been previously assessed. Methods. We pooled data for 3 736 individuals who received either CYD-TDV or placebo at 0, 6, and 12 months in the immu-nogenicity subsets of 2 phase 3 trials (clinical trials registration NCT01373281 and NCT01374516). We defined a seroconversion algorithm (ie, a {$\geq$}4-fold increase in the neutralizing antibody titer and a titer of {$\geq$}40 from month 13 to month 25) as a surrogate marker of asymptomatic infection in the vaccine and placebo groups. Results. The algorithm detected seroconversion in 94\% of individuals with a diagnosis of virologically confirmed dengue be-tween months 13 and 25, validating its discriminatory power. Among those without virologically confirmed dengue (n = 3 669), 219 of 2 485 in the vaccine group and 157 of 1 184 in the placebo group seroconverted between months 13 and 25, giving a vaccine efficacy of 33.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 17.9\%\textendash{}46.1\%) against asymptomatic infection. Vaccine efficacy was marginally higher in subjects aged 9\textendash{}16 years (38.6\%; 95\% CI, 22.1\%\textendash{}51.5\%). The annual incidence of asymptomatic dengue virus infection in this age group was 14.8\%, which was 4.4 times higher than the incidence for symptomatic dengue (3.4\%). Conclusions. The observed vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic dengue virus infections is expected to translate into reduced dengue virus transmission if sufficient individuals are vaccinated in dengue-endemic areas.},

Compared to reporting among similar pediatric populations in Managua, the PDCS identified 14 to 28 (average 21.3) times more dengue cases each year per 100,000 persons than were reported to the NES. Applying these annual expansion factors to national-level data, we estimate that the incidence of confirmed pediatric dengue throughout Nicaragua ranged from 300 to 1000 cases per 100,000 persons. We have estimated a much higher incidence of dengue than reported by the Ministry of Health. A country-specific expansion factor for dengue that allows for a more accurate estimate of incidence may aid governments and other institutions calculating disease burden, costs, resource needs for prevention and treatment, and the economic benefits of drug and vaccine development.},

  doi = {10.1016/PII},
  abstract = {Background Plasmodium falciparum sporozite (PfSPZ) Vaccine is a metabolically active, non-replicating, whole malaria sporozoite vaccine that has been reported to be safe and protective against P falciparum controlled human malaria infection in malaria-naive individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and protective effi cacy of PfSPZ Vaccine against naturally acquired P falciparum in malaria-experienced adults in Mali. Methods After an open-label dose-escalation study in a pilot safety cohort, we did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial based in Don\'egu\'ebougou and surrounding villages in Mali. We recruited 18\textendash{}35-year-old healthy adults who were randomly assigned (1:1) in a double-blind manner, with stratifi cation by village and block randomisation, to receive either fi ve doses of 2\textperiodcentered{}7 \texttimes{} 10{$^{5}$} PfSPZ or normal saline at days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 140 during the dry season (January to July inclusive). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignments, which were unmasked at the fi nal study visit, 6 months after receipt of the last vaccination. Participants received combined artemether and lumefantrine (four tablets, each containing 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, given twice per day over 3 days for a total of six doses) to eliminate P falciparum before the fi rst and last vaccinations. We collected blood smears every 2 weeks and during any illness for 24 weeks after the fi fth vaccination. The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of the vaccine, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. The sample size was calculated for the exploratory effi cacy endpoint of time to fi rst P falciparum infection beginning 28 days after the fi fth vaccination. The safety analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of investigational product, whereas the effi cacy analyses included only participants who received all fi ve vaccinations. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01988636. Findings Between Jan 18 and Feb 24, 2014, we enrolled 93 participants into the main study cohort with 46 participants assigned PfSPZ Vaccine and 47 assigned placebo, all of whom were evaluable for safety. We detected no signifi cant diff erences in local or systemic adverse events or laboratory abnormalities between the PfSPZ Vaccine and placebo groups, and only grade 1 (mild) local or systemic adverse events occurred in both groups. The most common solicited systemic adverse event in the vaccine and placebo groups was headache (three [7\%] people in the vaccine group vs four [9\%] in the placebo group) followed by fatigue (one [2\%] person in the placebo group), fever (one [2\%] person in the placebo group), and myalgia (one [2\%] person in each group). The exploratory effi cacy analysis included 41 participants from the vaccine group and 40 from the placebo group. Of these participants, 37 (93\%) from the placebo group and 27 (66\%) from the vaccine group developed P falciparum infection. The hazard ratio for vaccine effi cacy was 0\textperiodcentered{}517 (95\% CI 0\textperiodcentered{}313\textendash{}0\textperiodcentered{}856) by time-to-infection analysis (log-rank p=0\textperiodcentered{}01), and 0\textperiodcentered{}712 (0\textperiodcentered{}528\textendash{}0\textperiodcentered{}918) by proportional analysis (p=0\textperiodcentered{}006). Interpretation PfSPZ Vaccine was well tolerated and safe. PfSPZ Vaccine showed signifi cant protection in African adults against P falciparum infection throughout an entire malaria season.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.08.088},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND A candidate recombinant, live-attenuated, CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) has recently demonstrated immunogenicity, efficacy and good tolerability. This study was performed to evaluate three CYD-TDV formulations in adults. 

METHODS This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase II trial. The vaccine formulations were: CYD-TDV 5555 ({$\approx$}5log10 tissue culture infectious dose 50\% [TCID50] of serotypes 1\textendash{}4); CYD-TDV 5553 ({$\approx$}5log10 TCID50 of serotypes 1\textendash{}3 and {$\approx$}3log10 TCID50 of serotype 4); and CYD-TDV 4444 ({$\approx$}4log10 TCID50 of serotypes 1\textendash{}4). Vaccinations were administered at 0, 6 and 12 months. Immunogenicity was assessed using the plaque reduction neutralization test. 

RESULTS In total, 260 individuals were enrolled. The 5555 formulation elicited a superior serotype 4 response versus the 5553 formulation, with seropositivity rates of 89.7\% and 58.3\%, respectively, after the second dose (between-group difference 31.4\%; 95\% confidence interval 18.2\textendash{}43.2). After each of the three doses, seropositivity rates for serotypes 1\textendash{}3 were numerically highest with CYD-TDV 5553 and lowest with the 4444 formulation; seropositivity rates for serotype 4 were similar with the 5555 and 4444 formulations, and much lower among recipients of CYD-TDV 5553. Geometric mean titers followed the same pattern as that seen with seropositivity rates. Safety/reactogenicity results were similar for all three vaccine formulations, although the percentage of participants reporting solicited injection site reactions was lower with CYD-TDV 4444 than with the other two formulations. All serious adverse events were unrelated to vaccination. 

CONCLUSIONS Reducing the dose of serotype 4 antigen (5553 formulation) creates an imbalance in the immune response to CYD-TDV. Immune responses to CYD-TDV 5555 were slightly higher than to the 4444 formulation. Development of CYD-TDV 5555 has subsequently been pursued.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND A tetravalent dengue vaccine demonstrated its protective efficacy in two phase III efficacy studies. Results from these studies were used to derive vaccination impact in the five Asian (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and the five Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico) participating in these trials. METHODS Vaccination impact was investigated with an age-structured, host-vector, serotype-specific compartmental model. Parameters related to vaccine efficacy and levels of dengue transmission were estimated using data collected during the phase III efficacy studies. Several vaccination programs, including routine vaccination at different ages with and without large catch-up campaigns, were investigated. RESULTS All vaccination programs explored translated into significant reductions in dengue cases at the population level over the first 10years following vaccine introduction and beyond. The most efficient age for vaccination varied according to transmission intensity and 9years was close to the most efficient age across all settings. The combination of routine vaccination and large catch-up campaigns was found to enable a rapid reduction of dengue burden after vaccine introduction. CONCLUSION Our analysis suggests that dengue vaccination can significantly reduce the public health impact of dengue in countries where the disease is endemic.},

Over the past 50 years, incidence increased 30-fold: there were approximately 390 million infections in 2010. Globalization, trade, travel, demographic trends, and warming temperatures are associated with the recent spread of the primary vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and of dengue. Overall, models project that new geographic areas along the fringe of current geographic ranges for Aedes will become environmentally suitable for the mosquito's lifecycle, and for dengue transmission. Many endemic countries where dengue is likely to spread further have underdeveloped health systems, increasing the substantial challenges of disease prevention and control. Control focuses on management of Aedes, although these efforts have typically had limited effectiveness in preventing outbreaks. New prevention and control efforts are needed to counter the potential consequences of climate change on the geographic range and incidence of dengue, including novel methods of vector control and dengue vaccines.},

  abstract = {The unprecedented scale of the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015) has prompted an explosion of efforts to understand the transmission dynamics of the virus and to analyze the performance of possible containment strategies. Models have focused primarily on the reproductive numbers of the disease that represent the average number of secondary infections produced by a random infectious individual. However, these population-level estimates may conflate important systematic variation in the number of cases generated by infected individuals, particularly found in spatially localized transmission and superspreading events. Although superspreading features prominently in first-hand narratives of Ebola transmission, its dynamics have not been systematically characterized, hindering refinements of future epidemic predictions and explorations of targeted interventions. We used Bayesian model inference to integrate individual-level spatial information with other epidemiological data of community-based (undetected within clinical-care systems) cases and to explicitly infer distribution of the cases generated by each infected individual. Our results show that superspreaders play a key role in sustaining onward transmission of the epidemic, and they are responsible for a significant proportion ([Formula: see text]61\%) of the infections. Our results also suggest age as a key demographic predictor for superspreading. We also show that community-based cases may have progressed more rapidly than those notified within clinical-care systems, and most transmission events occurred in a relatively short distance (with median value of 2.51 km). Our results stress the importance of characterizing superspreading of Ebola, enhance our current understanding of its spatiotemporal dynamics, and highlight the potential importance of targeted control measures.},

The aim of this study was to refine clinical estimates provided by a regional surveillance-system using a two-stage serological assessment as gold standard. METHODS Two serosurveys were implemented: first, a rapid survey using stored sera of pregnant women, in order to assess the attack rate at the epidemic upsurge (s1, February 2006; n = 888); second, a population-based survey among a random sample of the community, to assess the herd immunity in the post-epidemic era (s2, October 2006; n = 2442). Sera were screened for anti-CHIKV specific antibodies (IgM and IgG in s1, IgG only in s2) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Seroprevalence rates were compared to clinical estimates of attack rates. RESULTS In s1, 18.2\% of the pregnant women were tested positive for CHIKV specific antibodies (13.8\% for both IgM and IgG, 4.3\% for IgM, 0.1\% for IgG only) which provided a congruent estimate with the 16.5\% attack rate calculated from the surveillance-system. In s2, the seroprevalence in community was estimated to 38.2\% (95\% CI, 35.9 to 40.6\%). Extrapolations of seroprevalence rates led to estimate, at 143,000 and at 300,000 (95\% CI, 283,000 to 320,000), the number of people infected in s1 and in s2, respectively. In comparison, the surveillance-system estimated at 130,000 and 266,000 the number of people infected for the same periods. CONCLUSION A rapid serosurvey in pregnant women can be helpful to assess the attack rate when large seroprevalence studies cannot be done. On the other hand, a population-based serosurvey is useful to refine the estimate when clinical diagnosis underestimates it. Our findings give valuable insights to assess the herd immunity along the course of epidemics.},

  abstract = {The signing authors together with the journal Systematic and Applied Microbiology (SAM) have started an ambitious project that has been conceived to provide a useful tool especially for the scientific microbial taxonomist community. The aim of what we have called "The All-Species Living Tree" is to reconstruct a single 16S rRNA tree harboring all sequenced type strains of the hitherto classified species of Archaea and Bacteria. This tree is to be regularly updated by adding the species with validly published names that appear monthly in the Validation and Notification lists of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. For this purpose, the SAM executive editors, together with the responsible teams of the ARB, SILVA, and LPSN projects (www.arb-home.de, www.arb-silva.de, and www.bacterio.cict.fr, respectively), have prepared a 16S rRNA database containing over 6700 sequences, each of which represents a single type strain of a classified species up to 31 December 2007. The selection of sequences had to be undertaken manually due to a high error rate in the names and information fields provided for the publicly deposited entries. In addition, from among the often occurring multiple entries for a single type strain, the best-quality sequence was selected for the project. The living tree database that SAM now provides contains corrected entries and the best-quality sequences with a manually checked alignment. The tree reconstruction has been performed by using the maximum likelihood algorithm RAxML. The tree provided in the first release is a result of the calculation of a single dataset containing 9975 single entries, 6728 corresponding to type strain gene sequences, as well as 3247 additional high-fquality sequences to give robustness to the reconstruction. Trees are dynamic structures that change on the basis of the quality and availability of the data used for their calculation. Therefore, the addition of new type strain sequences in further subsequent releases may help to resolve certain branching orders that appear ambiguous in this first release. On the web sites: www.elsevier.de/syapm and www.arb-silva.de/living-tree, the All-Species Living Tree team will release a regularly updated database compatible with the ARB software environment containing the whole 16S rRNA dataset used to reconstruct "The All-Species Living Tree". As a result, the latest reconstructed phylogeny will be provided. In addition to the ARB file, a readable multi-FASTA universal sequence editor file with the complete alignment will be provided for those not using ARB. There is also a complete set of supplementary tables and figures illustrating the selection procedure and its outcome. It is expected that the All-Species Living Tree will help to improve future classification efforts by simplifying the selection of the correct type strain sequences. For queries, information updates, remarks on the dataset or tree reconstructions shown, a contact email address has been created (living-tree@arb-silva.de). This provides an entry point for anyone from the scientific community to provide additional input for the construction and improvement of the first tree compiling all sequenced type strains of all prokaryotic species for which names had been validly published.},

Data sets with this property are termed heterochronous and have become increasingly common in several fields of biology, most notably the molecular epidemiology of rapidly evolving viruses. Here we introduce the cross-platform software tool, TempEst (formerly known as Path-O-Gen), for the visualization and analysis of temporally sampled sequence data. Given a molecular phylogeny and the dates of sampling for each sequence, TempEst uses an interactive regression approach to explore the association between genetic divergence through time and sampling dates. TempEst can be used to (1) assess whether there is sufficient temporal signal in the data to proceed with phylogenetic molecular clock analysis, and (2) identify sequences whose genetic divergence and sampling date are incongruent. Examination of the latter can help identify data quality problems, including errors in data annotation, sample contamination, sequence recombination, or alignment error. We recommend that all users of the molecular clock models implemented in BEAST first check their data using TempEst prior to analysis.},

The Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which had an existing infrastructure for research regarding viral hemorrhagic fever, has received and cared for patients with EVD since the beginning of the outbreak in Sierra Leone in May 2014. METHODS We reviewed available epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory records of patients in whom EVD was diagnosed between May 25 and June 18, 2014. We used quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays to assess the load of Ebola virus (EBOV, Zaire species) in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS Of 106 patients in whom EVD was diagnosed, 87 had a known outcome, and 44 had detailed clinical information available. The incubation period was estimated to be 6 to 12 days, and the case fatality rate was 74\%. Common findings at presentation included fever (in 89\% of the patients), headache (in 80\%), weakness (in 66\%), dizziness (in 60\%), diarrhea (in 51\%), abdominal pain (in 40\%), and vomiting (in 34\%). Clinical and laboratory factors at presentation that were associated with a fatal outcome included fever, weakness, dizziness, diarrhea, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine. Exploratory analyses indicated that patients under the age of 21 years had a lower case fatality rate than those over the age of 45 years (57\% vs. 94\%, P=0.03), and patients presenting with fewer than 100,000 EBOV copies per milliliter had a lower case fatality rate than those with 10 million EBOV copies per milliliter or more (33\% vs. 94\%, P=0.003). Bleeding occurred in only 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS The incubation period and case fatality rate among patients with EVD in Sierra Leone are similar to those observed elsewhere in the 2014 outbreak and in previous outbreaks. Although bleeding was an infrequent finding, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal manifestations were common. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).},

We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally, we compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, which coincides with both the earliest undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the beginning of the Holocene.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in marginal likelihood estimation for model selection in the field of Bayesian phylogenetics and molecular evolution have emphasized the poor performance of the harmonic mean estimator (HME). Although these studies have shown the merits of new approaches applied to standard normally distributed examples and small real-world data sets, not much is currently known concerning the performance and computational issues of these methods when fitting complex evolutionary and population genetic models to empirical real-world data sets. Further, these approaches have not yet seen widespread application in the field due to the lack of implementations of these computationally demanding techniques in commonly used phylogenetic packages. We here investigate the performance of some of these new marginal likelihood estimators, specifically, path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone (SS) sampling for comparing models of demographic change and relaxed molecular clocks, using synthetic data and real-world examples for which unexpected inferences were made using the HME. Given the drastically increased computational demands of PS and SS sampling, we also investigate a posterior simulation-based analogue of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a model comparison approach that shares with the HME the appealing feature of having a low computational overhead over the original MCMC analysis. We confirm that the HME systematically overestimates the marginal likelihood and fails to yield reliable model classification and show that the AICM performs better and may be a useful initial evaluation of model choice but that it is also, to a lesser degree, unreliable. We show that PS and SS sampling substantially outperform these estimators and adjust the conclusions made concerning previous analyses for the three real-world data sets that we reanalyzed.

Our method is similar to relaxing the constraints of the molecular clock on specific lineages within a phylogenetic tree. Using a combination of synthetic and empirical data sets, we demonstrate that the method estimates leaf-ages reliably and accurately. Potential applications of our approach include incorporating samples of uncertain or radiocarbon-infinite age into ancient DNA analyses, evaluating the temporal signal in a particular sequence or data set, and exploring the reliability of sequence ages that are somehow contentious.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Models of nucleotide substitution were constructed for combined analyses of heterogeneous sequence data (such as those of multiple genes) from the same set of species. The models account for different aspects of the heterogeneity in the evolutionary process of different genes, such as differences in nucleotide frequencies, in substitution rate bias (for example, the transition/transversion rate bias), and in the extent of rate variation across sites. Model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood and the likelihood ratio test was used to test hypotheses concerning sequence evolution, such as rate constancy among lineages (the assumption of a molecular clock) and proportionality of branch lengths for different genes. The example data from a segment of the mitochondrial genome of six hominoid species (human, common and pygmy chimpanzees, gorilla, orangutan, and siamang) were analyzed. Nucleotides at the three codon positions in the protein-coding regions and from the tRNA-coding regions were considered heterogeneous data sets. Statistical tests showed that the amount of evolution in the sequence data reflected in the estimated branch lengths can be explained by the codon-position effect and lineage effect of substitution rates. The assumption of a molecular clock could not be rejected when the data were analyzed separately or when the rate variation among sites was ignored. However, significant differences in substitution rate among lineages were found when the data sets were combined and when the rate variation among sites was accounted for in the models. Under the assumption that the orangutan and African apes diverged 13 million years ago, the combined analysis of the sequence data estimated the times for the human-chimpanzee separation and for the separation of the gorilla as 4.3 and 6.8 million years ago, respectively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In December 2013, an outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused by the Asian genotype was notified in the Caribbean. The outbreak has since spread to 38 regions in the Americas. By September 2014, the first autochthonous CHIKV infections were confirmed in Oiapoque, North Brazil, and in Feira de Santana, Northeast Brazil. METHODS We compiled epidemiological and clinical data on suspected CHIKV cases in Brazil and polymerase-chain-reaction-based diagnostic was conducted on 68 serum samples from patients with symptom onset between April and September 2014. Two imported and four autochthonous cases were selected for virus propagation, RNA isolation, full-length genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. We then followed CDC/PAHO guidelines to estimate the risk of establishment of CHIKV in Brazilian municipalities. RESULTS We detected 41 CHIKV importations and 27 autochthonous cases in Brazil. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicated local transmission of the Asian CHIKV genotype in Oiapoque. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that the ECSA genotype is circulating in Feira de Santana. The presumed index case of the ECSA genotype was an individual who had recently returned from Angola and developed symptoms in Feira de Santana. We estimate that, if CHIKV becomes established in Brazil, transmission could occur in 94\% of municipalities in the country and provide maps of the risk of importation of each strain of CHIKV in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS The etiological strains associated with the early-phase CHIKV outbreaks in Brazil belong to the Asian and ECSA genotypes. Continued surveillance and vector mitigation strategies are needed to reduce the future public health impact of CHIKV in the Americas.},

However, the functions of most of these conserved sequences have not yet been determined. The terminal regions of the genome also contain multiple conserved RNA structures. Functional data for many of these structures have been obtained. Three sets of complementary 3' and 5' terminal region sequences, some of which are located in conserved RNA structures, interact to form a panhandle structure that is required for initiation of minus strand RNA synthesis with the 5' terminal structure functioning as the promoter. How the switch from the terminal RNA structure base pairing to the long distance RNA-RNA interaction is triggered and regulated is not well understood but evidence suggests involvement of a cell protein binding to three sites on the 3' terminal RNA structures and a cis-acting metastable 3' RNA element in the 3' terminal RNA structure. Cell proteins may also be involved in facilitating exponential replication of nascent genomic RNA within replication vesicles at later times of the infection cycle. Other conserved RNA structures and/or sequences in the 3' and 5' terminal regions have been proposed to regulate genome translation. Additional functions of the 3' and 5' terminal sequences have also been reported.},

METHODS This report includes an analysis of completed pregnancies (which include live births and pregnancy losses, regardless of gestational age) in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC) with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection reported to the USZPR from January 15 to December 27, 2016. Birth defects potentially associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy include brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly, eye abnormalities, other consequences of central nervous system dysfunction, and neural tube defects and other early brain malformations. RESULTS During the analysis period, 1,297 pregnant women in 44 states were reported to the USZPR. Zika virus-associated birth defects were reported for 51 (5\%) of the 972 fetuses/infants from completed pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection (95\% confidence interval [CI]~=~4\%-7\%); the proportion was higher when restricted to pregnancies with laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (24/250 completed pregnancies [10\%, 95\% CI = 7\%-14\%]). Birth defects were reported in 15\% (95\% CI = 8\%-26\%) of fetuses/infants of completed pregnancies with confirmed Zika virus infection in the first trimester. Among 895 liveborn infants from pregnancies with possible recent Zika virus infection, postnatal neuroimaging was reported for 221 (25\%), and Zika virus testing of at least one infant specimen was reported for 585 (65\%). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE These findings highlight why pregnant women should avoid Zika virus exposure. Because the full clinical spectrum of congenital Zika virus infection is not yet known, all infants born to women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection during pregnancy should receive postnatal neuroimaging and Zika virus testing in addition to a comprehensive newborn physical exam and hearing screen. Identification and follow-up care of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection during pregnancy and infants with possible congenital Zika virus infection can ensure that appropriate clinical services are available.},

We confirm sustained human-to-human transmission within Sierra Leone and find no evidence for import or export of EBOV across national borders after its initial introduction. Using high-depth replicate sequencing, we observe both host-to-host transmission and recurrent emergence of intrahost genetic variants. We trace the increasing impact of purifying selection in suppressing the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations over time. Finally, we note changes in the mucin-like domain of EBOV glycoprotein that merit further investigation. These findings clarify the movement of EBOV within the region and describe viral evolution during prolonged human-to-human transmission.},

They may range from subclinical infection to dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and eventually dengue shock syndrome (DSS). As both cell tropism and tissue tropism of DENV are considered major determinants in the pathogenesis of dengue, there is a critical need for adequate tropism assays, animal models, and human autopsy data. More than 50 years of research on dengue has resulted in a host of literature, which strongly suggests that the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS involves viral virulence factors and detrimental host responses, collectively resulting in abnormal hemostasis and increased vascular permeability. Differential targeting of specific vascular beds is likely to trigger the localized vascular hyperpermeability underlying DSS. A personalized approach to the study of pathogenesis will elucidate the basis of individual risk for development of DHF and DSS as well as identify the genetic and environmental bases for differences in risk for development of severe disease.},

  abstract = {Although yellow fever has historically been one of the most important viral infections of humans, relatively little is known about the evolutionary processes that shape its genetic diversity. Similarly, there is limited information on the molecular epidemiology of yellow fever virus (YFV) in Africa even though it most likely first emerged on this continent. Through an analysis of complete E gene sequences, including a newly acquired viral collection from Central and West Africa (Senegal, Cameroon, Central African Republic, C\^ote d'Ivoire, Mali, and Mauritania), we show that YFV exhibits markedly lower rates of evolutionary change than dengue virus, despite numerous biological similarities between these two viruses. From this observation, along with a lack of clock-like evolutionary behavior in YFV, we suggest that vertical transmission, itself characterized by lower replication rates, may play an important role in the evolution of YFV in its enzootic setting. Despite a reduced rate of nucleotide substitution, phylogenetic patterns and estimates of times to common ancestry in YFV still accord well with the dual histories of colonialism and the slave trade, with areas of sylvatic transmission (such as Kedougou, Senegal) acting as enzootic/epidemic foci.},

By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments.

  abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used (2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

This problem is exacerbated by the exclusion of codon-based models from commonly employed model selection techniques, presumably due to the computational cost associated with codon models. We investigated an efficient alternative to standard nucleotide substitution models, in which codon position (CP) is incorporated into the model. We determined the most appropriate model for alignments of 177 RNA virus genes and 106 yeast genes, using 11 substitution models including one codon model and four CP models. The majority of analyzed gene alignments are best described by CP substitution models, rather than by standard nucleotide models, and without the computational cost of full codon models. These results have significant implications for phylogenetic inference of coding sequences as they make it clear that substitution models incorporating CPs not only are a computationally realistic alternative to standard models but may also frequently be statistically superior.},

  abstract = {Global dengue virus spread in tropical and sub-tropical regions has become a major international public health concern. It is evident that DENV genetic diversity plays a significant role in the immunopathology of the disease and that the identification of polymorphisms associated with adaptive responses is important for vaccine development. The investigation of naturally occurring genomic variants may play an important role in the comprehension of different adaptive strategies used by these mutants to evade the human immune system. In order to elucidate this role we sequenced the complete polyprotein-coding region of thirty-three DENV-3 isolates to characterize variants circulating under high endemicity in the city of S\~ao Jos\'e de Rio Preto, Brazil, during the onset of the 2006-07 epidemic. By inferring the evolutionary history on a local-scale and estimating rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonimous (dN) substitutions, we have documented at least two different introductions of DENV-3 into the city and detected 10 polymorphic codon sites under significant positive selection (dN/dS  1) and 8 under significant purifying selection (dN/dS  1). We found several polymorphic amino acid coding sites in the envelope (15), NS1 (17), NS2A (11), and NS5 (24) genes, which suggests that these genes may be experiencing relatively recent adaptive changes. Furthermore, some polymorphisms correlated with changes in the immunogenicity of several epitopes. Our study highlights the existence of significant and informative DENV variability at the spatio-temporal scale of an urban outbreak.},

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. Infection results in a dengue-like illness with fever, headache, malaise, and a maculopapular rash. Nearly all cases are mild and self-limiting but in 2007, a large outbreak of ZIKV was reported from the island of Yap (in Micronesia, northwest of Indonesia). Singapore is already endemic for dengue, and its impact on public health and economic burden is significant. Other dengue-like infections (e.g., Chikungunya virus) are present. Yet only 10\% of reported dengue cases have laboratory confirmation. The identification and control of other dengue-like, mosquito-transmitted infections is thus important for the health of Singapore's population, as well as its economy. Given that ZIKV shares the same Aedes mosquito vector with both dengue and Chikungunya, it is possible that this virus is present in Singapore and causing some of the mild dengue-like illness. A specific and sensitive one-step, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with an internal control (IC) was designed and tested on 88 archived samples of dengue-negative, Chikungunya-negative sera from patients presenting to our hospital with a dengue-like illness, to determine the presence of ZIKV in Singapore. The assay was specific for detection of ZIKV and displayed a lower limit of detection (LoD) of 140 copies viral RNA/reaction when tested on synthetic RNA standards prepared using pooled negative patient plasma. Of the 88 samples tested, none were positive for ZIKV RNA, however, the vast majority of these were from patients admitted to hospital and further study may be warranted in community-based environments.},

  doi = {10.1186/1743-422X-10-311},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito borne flavivirus is a pathogen affecting humans in Asia and Africa. ZIKV infection diagnosis relies on serology-which is challenging due to cross-reactions with other flaviviruses and/or absence or low titer of IgM and IgG antibodies at early phase of infection- virus isolation, which is labor intensive, time consuming and requires appropriate containment. Therefore, real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) is an appealing option as a rapid, sensitive and specific method for detection of ZIKV in the early stage of infection. So far, only one rRT-PCR assay has been described in the context of the outbreak in Micronesia in 2007. In this study, we described a one step rRT-PCR for ZIKV which can detect a wider genetic diversity of ZIKV isolates from Asia and Africa. RESULTS The NS5 protein coding regions of African ZIKV isolates were sequenced and aligned with representative flaviviruses sequences from GenBank to design primers and probe from conserved regions. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was evaluated to be 32 genome-equivalents and 0.05 plaque forming unit (pfu). The assay was shown to detect 37 ZIKV isolates covering a wide geographic in Africa and Asia over 36 years but none of the 31 other flaviviruses tested showing high analytical specificity. The rRT-PCR could be performed in less than 3 hours. This method was used successfully to detect ZIKV strains from field-caught mosquitoes. CONCLUSION We have developed a rapid, sensitive and specific rRT-PCR for detection of ZIKV. This assay is a useful tool for detection of ZIKV infection in regions where a number of other clinically indistinguishable arboviruses like dengue or chikungunya co-circulate. Further studies are needed to validate this assay in clinical positive samples collected during acute ZIKV infection.},

Phylogenetic studies have suggested cryptic subtype B circulation in the United States (US) throughout the 1970s and an even older presence in the Caribbean. However, these temporal and geographical inferences, based upon partial HIV-1 genomes that postdate the recognition of AIDS in 1981, remain contentious and the earliest movements of the virus within the US are unknown. We serologically screened 2,000 1970s serum samples and developed a highly sensitive approach for recovering viral RNA from degraded archival samples. Here, we report eight coding-complete genomes from US serum samples from 1978-1979-eight of the nine oldest HIV-1 group M genomes to date. This early, full-genome 'snapshot' reveals that the US HIV-1 epidemic exhibited extensive genetic diversity in the 1970s but also provides strong evidence for its emergence from a pre-existing Caribbean epidemic. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses estimate the jump to the US at around 1970 and place the ancestral US virus in New York City with 0.99 posterior probability support, strongly suggesting this was the crucial hub of early US HIV/AIDS diversification. Logistic growth coalescent models reveal epidemic doubling times of 0.86 and 1.12 years for the US and Caribbean, respectively, suggesting rapid early expansion in each location. Comparisons with more recent data reveal many of these insights to be unattainable without archival, full-genome sequences. We also recovered the HIV-1 genome from the individual known as 'Patient 0' (ref. 5) and found neither biological nor historical evidence that he was the primary case in the US or for subtype B as a whole. We discuss the genesis and persistence of this belief in the light of these evolutionary insights.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate relationships between HIV-1 evolution, including immune evasion, and markers of disease progression during chronic infection. DESIGN HIV-1 evolution and disease progression markers were evaluated over approximately 5 years of infection among 37 Kenyan women from a prospective, seroincident cohort. Evolution was measured in two genes, gag and env, which are primary targets of cellular and humoral immune responses, respectively. METHODS Proviral HIV-1 gag and env sequences were obtained from early and chronic infection when plasma viral load and CD4 cell counts were available. Human leukocyte antigen types were obtained to identify changes in gag cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. The breadth of the neutralizing antibody response was measured for each woman's plasma against a panel of six viruses. Tests of association were performed between virus evolution (diversity, divergence, and ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence), markers of disease progression (viral load and CD4 cell count), and immune parameters (gag cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope mutation and neutralizing antibody breadth). RESULTS HIV-1 gag and env diversity and divergence were highly correlated in early and late infection. Divergence in gag was strongly correlated with viral load, largely because of the accumulation of synonymous changes. Mutation in gag cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes was associated with higher viral load. There was evidence for adaptive evolution in env, but the extent of env evolution was only weakly associated with neutralizing antibody breadth. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that HIV-1 evolution in gag and env is highly correlated but exhibits gene-specific differences. The different immune pressures on these genes may partly explain differences in evolution and consequences for HIV-1 disease progression.},

While generally nonspecific, the clinical presentation corresponding to these two CHIKV/ZIKV coinfections reflected infection by the virus present at a higher titer. Aside from CHIKV and ZIKV, coinfections of other viral pathogens were not detected. The mNGS approach is promising for differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness and identification of coinfections, although targeted arbovirus screening may be sufficient in the current ZIKV outbreak setting.},

The NCBI Viral Genomes Resource is a reference resource designed to bring order to this sequence shockwave and improve usability of viral sequence data. The resource can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/ and catalogs all publicly available virus genome sequences and curates reference genome sequences. As the number of genome sequences has grown, so too have the difficulties in annotating and maintaining reference sequences. The rapid expansion of the viral sequence universe has forced a recalibration of the data model to better provide extant sequence representation and enhanced reference sequence products to serve the needs of the various viral communities. This, in turn, has placed increased emphasis on leveraging the knowledge of individual scientific communities to identify important viral sequences and develop well annotated reference virus genome sets.},

This paper summarizes the current status of the viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic branches of the RefSeq project, reports on improvements to data access and details efforts to further expand the taxonomic representation of the collection. We also highlight diverse functional curation initiatives that support multiple uses of RefSeq data including taxonomic validation, genome annotation, comparative genomics, and clinical testing.

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.ppat.0030201},
  abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging arbovirus associated with several recent large-scale epidemics. The 2005-2006 epidemic on Reunion island that resulted in approximately 266,000 human cases was associated with a strain of CHIKV with a mutation in the envelope protein gene (E1-A226V). To test the hypothesis that this mutation in the epidemic CHIKV (strain LR2006 OPY1) might influence fitness for different vector species, viral infectivity, dissemination, and transmission of CHIKV were compared in Aedes albopictus, the species implicated in the epidemic, and the recognized vector Ae. aegypti. Using viral infectious clones of the Reunion strain and a West African strain of CHIKV, into which either the E1-226 A or V mutation was engineered, we demonstrated that the E1-A226V mutation was directly responsible for a significant increase in CHIKV infectivity for Ae. albopictus, and led to more efficient viral dissemination into mosquito secondary organs and transmission to suckling mice. This mutation caused a marginal decrease in CHIKV Ae. aegypti midgut infectivity, had no effect on viral dissemination, and was associated with a slight increase in transmission by Ae. aegypti to suckling mice in competition experiments. The effect of the E1-A226V mutation on cholesterol dependence of CHIKV was also analyzed, revealing an association between cholesterol dependence and increased fitness of CHIKV in Ae. albopictus. Our observation that a single amino acid substitution can influence vector specificity provides a plausible explanation of how this mutant virus caused an epidemic in a region lacking the typical vector. This has important implications with respect to how viruses may establish a transmission cycle when introduced into a new area. Due to the widespread distribution of Ae. albopictus, this mutation increases the potential for CHIKV to permanently extend its range into Europe and the Americas.},

Almost simultaneously, a bayesian model averaging approach was developed that avoids conditioning on a single model but averages over a set of relaxed clock models. This approach returns estimates of the posterior probability of each clock model through which one can estimate the Bayes factor in favor of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) clock model; however, this Bayes factor estimate may suffer when the posterior probability of the MAP model approaches 1. Here, we compare these two recent developments with the HME, stabilized/smoothed HME (sHME), and AICM, using both synthetic and empirical data. Our comparison shows reassuringly that MAP identification and its Bayes factor provide similar performance to PS and SS and that these approaches considerably outperform HME, sHME, and AICM in selecting the correct underlying clock model. We also illustrate the importance of using proper priors on a large set of empirical data sets.},

Current sequencing technologies do not achieve sufficient coverage to assemble the individual genomes in a typical sample; consequently, sequencing runs produce a large number of short sequences whose exact origin is unknown. Since these sequences are usually smaller than the average length of a gene, algorithms must make predictions based on very little data. RESULTS We present MetaProdigal, a metagenomic version of the gene prediction program Prodigal, that can identify genes in short, anonymous coding sequences with a high degree of accuracy. The novel value of the method consists of enhanced translation initiation site identification, ability to identify sequences that use alternate genetic codes and confidence values for each gene call. We compare the results of MetaProdigal with other methods and conclude with a discussion of future improvements.

  abstract = {Brazil has experienced an unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), with \~30,000 cases reported to date. ZIKV was first detected in Brazil in May 2015, and cases of microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection were identified in November 2015. We performed next-generation sequencing to generate seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes sampled from four self-limited cases, one blood donor, one fatal adult case, and one newborn with microcephaly and congenital malformations. Results of phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a single introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, which we estimated to have occurred between May and December 2013, more than 12 months before the detection of ZIKV in Brazil. The estimated date of origin coincides with an increase in air passengers to Brazil from ZIKV-endemic areas, as well as with reported outbreaks in the Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are phylogenetically interspersed with those from other South American and Caribbean countries. Mapping mutations onto existing structural models revealed the context of viral amino acid changes present in the outbreak lineage; however, no shared amino acid changes were found among the three currently available virus genomes from microcephaly cases. Municipality-level incidence data indicate that reports of suspected microcephaly in Brazil best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 17 of pregnancy, although this correlation does not demonstrate causation. Our genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of this emerging virus in the Americas.},

  abstract = {Following the emergence of Zika in the past decade, there are lessons to be learned from similar emergence events of dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). Specifically, as Zika emerges in the Americas there is a natural tendency to apply the knowledge base of DENV and CHIKV to mitigation and control of a virus with such a similar transmission system. However, there are marked differences that may preclude such broad stroke application of this knowledge base without making potentially faulty assumptions. Herein, Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission is reviewed, and the commonalities among these three arboviruses are discussed. Importantly, the divergence of this particular arbovirus is discussed, as is the need to develop ZIKV-specific knowledge base for mitigation of this disease. Specifically reviewed are 1) emergence and persistence patterns, 2) genetic and phenotypic diversity, 3) vector host range, and finally, 4) alternate transmission routes and added complexity of ZIKV transmission and presentation.},

We demonstrate how phase angle statistics can be used to gain confidence in causal relationships and test mechanistic models of physical relationships between the time series. As an example of typical data where such analyses have proven useful, we apply the methods to the Arctic Oscillation index and the Baltic maximum sea ice extent record. Monte Carlo methods are used to assess the statistical significance against red noise backgrounds.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An estimated 2.4 billion people live in areas at risk of dengue transmission, therefore the factors determining the establishment of endemic dengue in areas where transmission suitability is marginal is of considerable importance. Hanoi, Vietnam is such an area, and following a large dengue outbreak in 2009, we set out to determine if dengue is emerging in Hanoi. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook a temporal and spatial analysis of 25,983 dengue cases notified in Hanoi between 1998 and 2009. Age standardized incidence rates, standardized age of infection, and Standardized Morbidity Ratios (SMR) were calculated. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to determine if dengue incidence was increasing over time. Wavelet analysis was used to explore the periodicity of dengue transmission and the association with climate variables. After excluding the two major outbreak years of 1998 and 2009 and correcting for changes in population age structure, we identified a significant annual increase in the incidence of dengue cases over the period 1999-2008 (incidence rate ratio = 1.38, 95\% confidence interval = 1.20-1.58, p value = 0.002). The age of notified dengue cases in Hanoi is high, with a median age of 23 years (mean 26.3 years). After adjusting for changes in population age structure, there was no statistically significant change in the median or mean age of dengue cases over the period studied. Districts in the central, highly urban, area of Hanoi have the highest incidence of dengue (SMR3). CONCLUSIONS: Hanoi is a low dengue transmission setting where dengue incidence has been increasing year on year since 1999. This trend needs to be confirmed with serological surveys, followed by studies to determine the underlying drivers of this emergence. Such studies can provide insights into the biological, demographic, and environmental changes associated with vulnerability to the establishment of endemic dengue.},

We use wavelet phase analysis, which allows for dynamical non-stationarity--a complication in interpreting spatio-temporal patterns in these and many other ecological time series. In the pre-vaccination era, conspicuous hierarchical waves of infection moved regionally from large cities to small towns; the introduction of measles vaccination restricted but did not eliminate this hierarchical contagion. A mechanistic stochastic model suggests a dynamical explanation for the waves-spread via infective 'sparks' from large 'core' cities to smaller 'satellite' towns. Thus, the spatial hierarchy of host population structure is a prerequisite for these infection waves.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mosquito-borne dengue viruses are a major public health problem throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Changes in temperature and precipitation have well-defined roles in the transmission cycle and may thus play a role in changing incidence levels. The El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a multiyear climate driver of local temperature and precipitation worldwide. Previous studies have reported varying degrees of association between ENSO and dengue incidence. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the relationship between ENSO, local weather, and dengue incidence in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Thailand using wavelet analysis to identify time- and frequency-specific association. In Puerto Rico, ENSO was transiently associated with temperature and dengue incidence on multiyear scales. However, only local precipitation and not temperature was associated with dengue on multiyear scales. In Thailand, ENSO was associated with both temperature and precipitation. Although precipitation was associated with dengue incidence, the association was nonstationary and likely spurious. In Mexico, no association between any of the variables was observed on the multiyear scale. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for a relationship between ENSO, climate, and dengue incidence presented here is weak. While multiyear climate variability may play a role in endemic interannual dengue dynamics, we did not find evidence of a strong, consistent relationship in any of the study areas. The role of ENSO may be obscured by local climate heterogeneity, insufficient data, randomly coincident outbreaks, and other, potentially stronger, intrinsic factors regulating transmission dynamics.},

Although principally endemic to Africa and Asia, recent outbreaks have occurred in Europe following introductions by returning travellers. A particularly large outbreak occurred on R\'eunion Island in 2006, the published data from which forms the basis of the current study. A simple, deterministic mathematical model of the transmission of the virus between humans and mosquitoes was constructed and parameterised with the up-to-date literature on infection biology. The model is fitted to the large R\'eunion epidemic, resulting in an estimate of 4.1 for the type reproduction number of chikungunya. Although simplistic, the model provided a close approximation of both the peak incidence of the outbreak and the final epidemic size. Sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated the strong influence that both the latent period of infection in humans and the pre-patent period have on these two epidemiological outcomes. We show why separating these variables, which are epidemiologically distinct in chikungunya infections, is not only necessary for accurate model fitting but also important in informing control.},

We propose a metapopulation model to represent both a high-resolution patch model of the island with realistic population densities and also mobility models for humans (based on real-motion data) and mosquitoes. In this metapopulation network, two models are coupled: one for the dynamics of the mosquito population and one for the transmission of the disease. A high-resolution numerical model is created from real geographical, demographical and mobility data. The Island is modeled with an 18,000-nodes metapopulation network. Numerical results show the impact of the geographical environment and populations' mobility on the spread of the disease.

The spatio-temporal evolution of these diseases is determined by the interaction of the host and vector, which is strongly dependent on social structures and mobility patterns. We develop an agent-based model (ABM), in which each individual is explicitly represented and vector populations are linked to precipitation estimates in a tropical setting. The model is implemented on both scale-free and regular networks. The spatio-temporal transmission of chikungunya is analysed and the presence of asymptomatic silent spreaders within the population is investigated in the context of implementing travel restrictions during an outbreak. Preventing the movement of symptomatic individuals is found to be an insufficient mechanism to halt the spread of the disease, which can be readily carried to neighbouring nodes via sub-clinical individuals. Furthermore, the impact of topology structure vs. precipitation levels is assessed and precipitation is found to be the dominant factor driving spatio-temporal transmission.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A competent vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses, Aedes albopictus, is present in Europe. As a first step towards assessing the likelihood of local transmission of these viruses in Europe, we estimated the number of viremic person-days among air-travellers arriving in the European Union (EU). METHODS: For dengue, we developed a Monte Carlo model with the following parameters: probability distributions based on quarterly incidences in endemic countries (years 2003-2007), passenger flow from endemic to EU countries (year 2006), duration of viremia, probability of being viremic upon arrival, distribution and period of vector activity in the EU. For chikungunya, due to scarce incidence data, we developed a model with point estimates. RESULTS: We estimated at 4763 (range 3067-7019) the median dengue viremic person-days in 2006 with highest estimate among travellers from Asia during the third quarter. Dengue estimates among travellers arriving in EU Aedes-infested areas from April to October were 169 viremic person-days, 130 arriving in Italy. For chikungunya, we estimated 6 viremic person-days in EU Aedes-infested areas among air-travellers from India; all occurred in Italy. CONCLUSION: Our results are a first step towards a real estimation of the risk of local dengue transmission in Europe. Further research is needed to better understand vector capacity and other factors related to virus transmission in temperate climates. Information on personal protection to travellers, early diagnosis and implementation of vector monitoring and control should be a priority in EU areas where the vector is established.},

  abstract = {Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral infection of humans that previously was confined to regions in central Africa. However, during this century, the virus has shown surprising potential for geographic expansion as it invaded other countries including more temperate regions. With no vaccine and no specific treatment, the main control strategy for Chikungunya remains preventive control of mosquito populations. In consideration for the risk of Chikungunya introduction to the US, we developed a model for disease introduction based on virus introduction by one individual. Our study combines a climate-based mosquito population dynamics stochastic model with an epidemiological model to identify temporal windows that have epidemic risk. We ran this model with temperature data from different locations to study the geographic sensitivity of epidemic potential. We found that in locations with marked seasonal variation in temperature there also was a season of epidemic risk matching the period of the year in which mosquito populations survive and grow. In these locations controlling mosquito population sizes might be an efficient strategy. But, in other locations where the temperature supports mosquito development all year the epidemic risk is high and (practically) constant. In these locations, mosquito population control alone might not be an efficient disease control strategy and other approaches should be implemented to complement it. Our results strongly suggest that, in the event of an introduction and establishment of Chikungunya in the US, endemic and epidemic regions would emerge initially, primarily defined by environmental factors controlling annual mosquito population cycles. These regions should be identified to plan different intervention measures. In addition, reducing vector: human ratios can lower the probability and magnitude of outbreaks for regions with strong seasonal temperature patterns. This is the first model to consider Chikungunya risk in the US and can be applied to other vector borne diseases.},

  abstract = {Since the 1980s, there has been a worldwide re-emergence of vector-borne diseases including Malaria, Dengue, Yellow fever or, more recently, chikungunya. These viruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by arthropods like mosquitoes of Aedes genus. The nature of these arboviruses is complex since it conjugates human, environmental, biological and geographical factors. Recent researchs have suggested, in particular during the Reunion Island epidemic in 2006, that the transmission by Aedes albopictus (an Aedes genus specie) has been facilitated by genetic mutations of the virus and the vector capacity to adapt to non tropical regions. In this paper we formulate an optimal control problem, based on biological observations. Three main efforts are considered in order to limit the virus transmission. Indeed, there is no vaccine nor specific treatment against chikungunya, that is why the main measures to limit the impact of such epidemic have to be considered. Therefore, we look at time dependent breeding sites destruction, prevention and treatment efforts, for which optimal control theory is applied. Using analytical and numerical techniques, it is shown that there exist cost effective control efforts.},

The virus was first detected in Cambodia in 2011 and a large outbreak occurred in the village of Trapeang Roka Kampong Speu Province in March 2012, in which 44\% of the villagers had a recent infection biologically confirmed. The epidemic curve was constructed from the number of biologically-confirmed CHIKV cases per day determined from the date of fever onset, which was self-reported during a data collection campaign conducted in the village after the outbreak. All individuals participating in the campaign had infections confirmed by laboratory analysis, allowing for the identification of asymptomatic cases and those with an unreported date of fever onset. We develop a stochastic model explicitly including such cases, all of whom do not appear on the epidemic curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the outbreak to be 6.46 (95\% C.I. [6.24, 6.78]). We show that this estimate is particularly sensitive to changes in the biting rate and mosquito longevity. Our model also indicates that the infection was more widespread within the population on the reported epidemic start date. We show that the exclusion of asymptomatic cases and cases with undocumented onset dates can lead to an underestimation of the reproduction number which, in turn, could negatively impact control strategies implemented by public health authorities. We highlight the need for properly documenting newly emerging pathogens in immunologically naive populations and the importance of identifying the route of disease introduction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chikungunya, an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, causes a febrile disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. This infection is reaching endemic levels in many Southeast Asian countries. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain with or without swelling, low back pain, and rash. According to the World Health Organization, there are 2 billion people living in Aedes-infested areas. In addition, traveling to these areas is popular, making the potential risk of infections transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes very high. METHODS: We proposed a mathematical model to estimate the risk of acquiring chikungunya fever in an Aedes-infested area by taking the prevalence of dengue fever into account. The basic reproduction number for chikungunya fever R(0chik) can be written as a function of the basic reproduction number of dengue R(0dengue) by calculating the ratio R(0chik)/R(0dengue). From R(0chik), we estimated the force of infection and the risk of acquiring the disease both for local residents of a dengue-endemic area and for travelers to this area. RESULTS: We calculated that R(0chik) is 64.4\% that of R(0dengue). The model was applied to a hypothetical situation, namely, estimating the individual risk of acquiring chikungunya fever in a dengue-endemic area, both for local inhabitants (22\% in steady state) and for visiting travelers (from 0.31\% to 1.23\% depending on the time spent in the area). CONCLUSIONS: The method proposed based on the output of a dynamical model is innovative and provided an estimation of the risk of infection, both for local inhabitants and for visiting travelers.},

In the present paper, we asked whether it would have been possible to contain or stop the epidemic of 2006 through appropriate mosquito control tools. Based on new results on the Chikungunya virus, its impact on mosquito life-span, and several experiments done by health authorities, we studied several types of control tools used in 2006 to contain the epidemic. We present an analysis of the model, and we develop a new nonstandard finite difference scheme to provide several simulations with and without mosquito control. Our preliminary study shows that an early use of a combination of massive spraying and mechanical control (like the destruction of breeding sites) can be efficient, to stop or contain the propagation of Chikungunya infection, with a low impact on the environment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on spatiotemporal clustering of human dengue virus (DENV) infections, transmission is thought to occur at fine spatiotemporal scales by horizontal transfer of virus between humans and mosquito vectors. To define the dimensions of local transmission and quantify the factors that support it, we examined relationships between infected humans and Aedes aegypti in Thai villages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Geographic cluster investigations of 100-meter radius were conducted around DENV-positive and DENV-negative febrile "index" cases (positive and negative clusters, respectively) from a longitudinal cohort study in rural Thailand. Child contacts and Ae. aegypti from cluster houses were assessed for DENV infection. Spatiotemporal, demographic, and entomological parameters were evaluated. In positive clusters, the DENV infection rate among child contacts was 35.3\% in index houses, 29.9\% in houses within 20 meters, and decreased with distance from the index house to 6.2\% in houses 80-100 meters away (p0.001). Significantly more Ae. aegypti were DENV-infectious (i.e., DENV-positive in head/thorax) in positive clusters (23/1755; 1.3\%) than negative clusters (1/1548; 0.1\%). In positive clusters, 8.2\% of mosquitoes were DENV-infectious in index houses, 4.2\% in other houses with DENV-infected children, and 0.4\% in houses without infected children (p0.001). The DENV infection rate in contacts was 47.4\% in houses with infectious mosquitoes, 28.7\% in other houses in the same cluster, and 10.8\% in positive clusters without infectious mosquitoes (p0.001). Ae. aegypti pupae and adult females were more numerous only in houses containing infectious mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Human and mosquito infections are positively associated at the level of individual houses and neighboring residences. Certain houses with high transmission risk contribute disproportionately to DENV spread to neighboring houses. Small groups of houses with elevated transmission risk are consistent with over-dispersion of transmission (i.e., at a given point in time, people/mosquitoes from a small portion of houses are responsible for the majority of transmission).},

Knowledge about the epidemiology and host determinants of inapparent and severe dengue virus infections is limited. In this paper, the authors report findings from the first 3 years of a prospective study of dengue virus transmission and disease severity conducted in a cohort of 2,119 elementary school children in northern Thailand. A total of 717,106 person-school days were observed from 1998 to 2000. The incidence of inapparent and of symptomatic dengue virus infection was 4.3\% and 3.6\% in 1998, 3.2\% and 3.3\% in 1999, and 1.4\% and 0.8\% in 2000, respectively. Symptomatic dengue virus infection was responsible for 3.2\%, 7.1\%, and 1.1\% of acute-illness school absences in 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. The early symptom complex of acute dengue virus infection is protean and difficult to distinguish from other causes of febrile childhood illnesses. The authors' results illustrate the spatial and temporal diversity of dengue virus infection and the burden of dengue disease in schoolchildren in Thailand. Their findings increase understanding of dengue virus transmission and disease severity in a well-defined cohort population and offer a study design in which to test the efficacy of potential dengue vaccines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infection with any 1 of the 4 dengue viruses (DVs) can produce several illnesses, ranging from a mild febrile illness to classic dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a potentially life-threatening disease. Most DHF cases occur after sequential heterotypic DV infections. The role of preexisting humoral immunity in modifying severity of dengue disease is not well understood. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children in a region where dengue disease is hyperendemic and examined the role of preexisting neutralizing anti-DV antibodies (Abs) in modifying secondary dengue-3 virus (D3V), dengue-2 virus (D2V), and dengue-1 virus (D1V) infections. RESULTS: In secondary D3V infection, higher levels of preexisting neutralizing Ab directed against D3V (reference virus strain and patient's virus isolate) were associated with lower viremia levels and milder disease. Preexisting neutralizing Ab levels against D2V were not associated with severity of secondary D2V infection. The levels of preexisting neutralizing Ab against the infecting virus isolates were not associated with viremia levels in secondary D2V or D1V infections. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-reactive memory humoral immune responses appear to be beneficial in symptomatic secondary D3V infection, but not in secondary D2V or D1V infection. These results may have important implications for the development of live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccines.},

  abstract = {Background A candidate tetravalent dengue vaccine is being assessed in three clinical trials involving more than 35,000 children between the ages of 2 and 16 years in Asian-Pacific and Latin American countries. We report the results of long-term follow-up interim analyses and integrated efficacy analyses. Methods We are assessing the incidence of hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue as a surrogate safety end point during follow-up in years 3 to 6 of two phase 3 trials, CYD14 and CYD15, and a phase 2b trial, CYD23/57. We estimated vaccine efficacy using pooled data from the first 25 months of CYD14 and CYD15. Results Follow-up data were available for 10,165 of 10,275 participants (99\%) in CYD14 and 19,898 of 20,869 participants (95\%) in CYD15. Data were available for 3203 of the 4002 participants (80\%) in the CYD23 trial included in CYD57. During year 3 in the CYD14, CYD15, and CYD57 trials combined, hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue occurred in 65 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 39 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled relative risks of hospitalization for dengue were 0.84 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.24) among all participants, 1.58 (95\% CI, 0.83 to 3.02) among those under the age of 9 years, and 0.50 (95\% CI, 0.29 to 0.86) among those 9 years of age or older. During year 3, hospitalization for severe dengue, as defined by the independent data monitoring committee criteria, occurred in 18 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 6 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled rates of efficacy for symptomatic dengue during the first 25 months were 60.3\% (95\% CI, 55.7 to 64.5) for all participants, 65.6\% (95\% CI, 60.7 to 69.9) for those 9 years of age or older, and 44.6\% (95\% CI, 31.6 to 55.0) for those younger than 9 years of age. Conclusions Although the unexplained higher incidence of hospitalization for dengue in year 3 among children younger than 9 years of age needs to be carefully monitored during long-term follow-up, the risk among children 2 to 16 years of age was lower in the vaccine group than in the control group.

Dengue virus (DENV) transmission dynamics was studied in Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand, using an enhanced spatiotemporal surveillance of 93 hospitalized subjects with confirmed dengue (initiates) and associated cluster individuals (associates) with entomologic sampling. A total of 438 associates were enrolled from 208 houses with household members with a history of fever, located within a 200-m radius of an initiate case. Of 409 associates, 86 (21\%) had laboratory-confirmed DENV infection. A total of 63 (1.8\%) of the 3,565 mosquitoes collected were dengue polymerase chain reaction positive (PCR+). There was a significant relationship between spatial proximity to the initiate case and likelihood of detecting DENV from associate cases and Aedes mosquitoes. The viral detection rate from human hosts and mosquito vectors in this study was higher than previously observed by the study team in the same geographic area using different methodologies.

Analysis at the laboratory level showed that only 40\% of the laboratories (20/50), representing 45\% of the countries, scored sufficiently; i.e., they had at least one test operational that scored all core samples correctly. There is a need for improvement of the molecular detection of ZIKV in 60\% of the participating laboratories. While the specificity of the tests was more robust, the results of the EQA showed large variation in test sensitivity. Improvements should focus on both nucleic acid extraction and ZIKV detection methods.},

  title = {Model-Based Assessment of Public Health Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Dengue Vaccination Following Screening for Prior Exposure},
  doi = {10.1101/367060},
  abstract = {The tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia\textregistered{}) is the first licensed vaccine against dengue, but recent findings indicate an elevated risk of severe disease among vaccinees without prior dengue virus (DENV)  exposure. The World Health Organization currently recommends CYD-TDV only for individuals with serological confirmation of past DENV exposure. Our objective was to evaluate the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination  following serological screening. To do so, we used an agent-based model to simulate DENV transmission with and without vaccination over a 10-year timeframe. Across a range of values for the proportion of vaccinees with prior DENV exposure, we projected  the proportion of symptomatic and hospitalized cases averted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of serological screening. Scenarios about the cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination were chosen to be representative of Brazil and  the Philippines. We found that public health impact depended primarily on sensitivity in high-transmission settings and on specificity in low-transmission settings. Cost-effectiveness could be achievable from the perspective of a public payer  provided that sensitivity and the value of a disability-adjusted life-year were both high, but only in high-transmission settings. Requirements for reducing relative risk and achieving cost-effectiveness from an individual perspective were more  restricted, due to the fact that those who test negative pay for screening but receive no benefit. Our results predict that cost-effectiveness could be achieved only in high-transmission areas of dengue-endemic countries with a relatively high per  capita GDP, such as Panam\'a (13,680 USD), Brazil (8,649 USD), M\'exico (8,201 USD), or Thailand (5,807 USD). In conclusion, vaccination with CYD-TDV following serological screening could have a positive impact in some high-transmission  settings, provided that screening is highly specific (to minimize individual harm), at least moderately sensitive (to maximize population benefit), and sufficiently inexpensive (depending on the setting).AUTHOR SUMMARY Among several viral diseases  transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, dengue imposes the greatest and most persistent burden on global health. Efforts to curb its spread would benefit greatly from the availability of an effective vaccine. Currently, the only licensed dengue  vaccine, known as CYD-TDV or by the brand name Dengvaxia\textregistered, is only recommended for use in people who are known to have been exposed to dengue virus in the past. Because symptoms of dengue can range from severe to mild to imperceptible,  using clinical history alone to assess whether a person was previously exposed is unreliable. Instead, serological assays, which measure a persons immune response to dengue virus, are necessary to confirm whether a person was  previously exposed. Because serological assays can be subject to substantial error, we used a simulation model to assess how impactful CYD-TDV vaccination would be under different scenarios about the accuracy of a serological assay and the intensity  of transmission in a given area. We found that the health impact and cost-effectiveness of CYD-TDV vaccination depended on the accuracy of the serological assay, its cost, and the setting in which it is deployed.},
